<h3>Description</h3>
The Krstjani were a Christian sect that believed in Mysticism (sometimes referred to as dualism), whose members called themselves "true believers". The main goal of the mysticism is closeness with God or Christ achieved through the mystical experience of oneness, union, imitation, conjunction or immersion. The whole Krstjani life is an imitation of Christ and unity with God in Christ. They believed in the interconnectedness of the material and spiritual world, which was expressed through the "Goodness" that came from the one God. Evil arises from a lack of "goodness" and a departure from spiritual values, so monastic life was valued above worldly life. The Krstjani read the Scriptures allegorically, paying special attention to the Apocalypse, the only prophetic book in the New Testament. The Bosnian Church had a full-fledged church organisation with a hierarchy, and was very often involved in the political and social life of the country. The head of the church, called djed, had the influence and reputation to handle state affairs. He was considered as the only true heir of St. Peter's. The Bosnian Church was usually supported by the Bans and Kings of Bosnia, as well as by a local nobleman. From the 1420s, church representatives were gradually pushed out of the royal service, and Catholicism was introduced into the royal domain. With the Catholicisation and Ottoman conquest of Bosnia, the Bosnian church organisation was disintegrated. From the 16th century, most of the Krstjani voluntarily converted to Islam in the form of Sufism.

<h3>Description</h3>
After the death of King Tvrko I Bosnia entered a period of feudal anarchy. Local landlords, acting as sovereign Kings, struggled constantly for the crown. Bloody showdowns were common among the great families, and the King's power were fading away. Such landlords were Sandalj Hranic Kosaca in Hum (Hercegovina) and Petar Pavlovic in Podrinje. They didn't hesitate to call for foreign intervention. Some of them sought the help of the Ottoman Empire, others still believed that the Hungarians are strong enough to save them from the Turkish menace. Meanwhile Turkish raids began, devastating the country, ruining the economy.

<h3>Description</h3>
An opportunist by nature, Tvrtko II, Ottoman vassal, sought to break free from his master. In 1423, two years after his coronation, Tvrtko tried to form closer relationship with Republic of Venice. In 1424, a small Ottoman army raided Bosnia as a warning, but this didn't change Tvrtko's mind much. In 1425, Tvrtko II started negotiations with Emperor Sigismund to join the league against Ottomans. He agreed to Sigismund's demand to name Count Hermann of Cilli, one of most powerful Hungarian nobles, as his heir. The alliance with Hungary was delayed, however, because of Hungarian failures against Hussites in Bohemia. After punishing Serbia for dealing with Hungarians, Ottomans sent another raiding expedition into Bosnia in 1426. Determined to ally with Hungary, Tvrtko II named Hermann of Cilli heir to the Bosnian throne if Tvrtko dies without a heir or his heir dies without one. In 1428, Tvrtko II got even closer to his goals by marrying daughter of a Hungarian noble.

<h3>Description</h3>
Kingdom of Bosnia was a chaotic realms where dukes constantly battle each other for territories. The most famous rivalry of that age was between Pavlovic and Kosaca families. After a quiet period, the rivalry revived when Duke Radoslav Pavlovic attacked and defeated the Republic of Ragusa because they tried to turn Cavtat, a town they bought from him, into a fortress. Duke Sandalj Hranic Kosaca immediately intervened on Ragusan side and attacked his archrival. King Tvrtko II was mostly helpless to solve the dispute. Since Duke Sandalj had the support of the Ottomans, Duke Radoslav asked Despot Djuradj of Serbia to broker peace. At almost the same time, King Tvrtko II went to war with Zlatonosovic family in eastern Bosnia. Since they were friends of Duke Sandalj and Serbian Despot, King Tvrtko II decided to throw his lot with Duke Radoslav. A real civil war started in Bosnia. As Kings faction began to loose the war, treacherous Duke Radoslav switched sides and joined the Serbian Despot's camp in 1433. This coalition of Serbian Despot and Bosnian Dukes put forth their own candidate for Tvrtko's replacement: Radivoj. The hostilities temporarily ceased when Emperor Sigismund announced his support for King Tvrtko II and Despot Djuradj withdrew from the conflict. Hungarian army arrived as promised in 1434 and changed the tide of the battle. Coalition of rebellious Dukes was defeated and forts held by Ottomans liberated. Duke Sandalj was crushed by Duke Djuradj Vojsalic, who joined forces with King Tvrtko II when Hugarian army arrived, and died from illness in March 1435. King Tvrtko traveled to Hungarty to swear vassalage to Emperor Sigismund. Upon his return to Bosnia, he started a campaign together with Duke Radoslav Pavlovic to destroy Stepan Vukcic, the new Duke Kosaca. King Tvtrko II was also aided by Croatian Prinecs Ivan and Stepan Frankopan who acted on the orders of Emperor Sigismund. Ottomans intervened on the behalf of Stepan Vukcic and reconquered one of the forts in Bosnia holding it against Hungarian troops until the end of the conflict. In 1436, Ivan Frankopan is denied the succession of the estates that belonged to his late father-in-law and switches sides to join Duke Stepan Vukcic. Hungarian army defeated and probably killed Ivan Frankopan. King Tvrtko II realized that he will not be able to expel the Turks from Bosnia and crush Stepan Vukcic, so he renewed his oath to Ottoman Sultan and reconciled with his enemy. Together with Stepan Vukcic and the Ottoman forces, the King turned on Duke Radoslav and utterly defeated him in 1438. It is said that around 16 monasteries and churches were burned during this civil war, and this is only a part of the devastation that was caused.

In 1435 the former King, Tvrko II returned. His enemy aided by the Turks, Radivoj couldn't withstand the pretender's attack and fled. He was unable to accept this outcome and kept his title, signing his letters as the King of Bosnia until his execution by the Turks in 1463. The rule of Tvrko was once more restored, and this time he managed to stabilize his throne. Murad II appointed Turkish military leaders to 'defend and ensure peace' in Bosnia, tightening his grip on the country.

<h3>Description</h3>
By the second half of the 15th century, the great lords of Bosnia, whose feuds destroyed the country and caused a lot of suffering, died out. Some of them lost their lives in one of those bloody showdowns, some of them died peacefully, allowing only one familiy to rise into prominent heights. In 1440 the son of Sandalj Hranic Kosaca, Stjepan Vukcic controlled Bosnia's southern territories, called the 'Hum and the Coast', and his power equalled the King's.

<h3>Description</h3>
Now that Bosnia is a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, Duke Stepan Vukcic Kosaca is the most powerful noble in the realm. Stepan Vukcic had claims on Zeta as husband of Jelena, daughter of late Balsa III, the last ruler of independent Zeta. He attacked Zeta while Serbia was being conquered by his Ottoman allies, gaining support of rebellious local Crnojevic family. The last Serbian stronghold in Zeta fell to Stepan Vukcic in 1441, just after the mining town of Novo Brdo fell to Ottomans. Stepan was stopped by Venetian towns in lower Zeta. Agitated by Serbian Despot Djuradj, most Montenegrins joined with Venetian defenders. Only citizens of Bar supported the Bosnian Duke. Stepan was temporarily force to halt his attack on Zeta in 1442 because of rebellion of his closes cousin, Ivan Vukovic, but resumed his operations later in the year. His army was immediately defeated near Bar but Venetians refused to negotiate peace treaty while he still held the town. In December 1442, however, Stepan Vukcic was more successful and made progress all the way to Scutari in the east of Zeta. Duke Stepan was joined by Ottoman troops from Albania in 1443 and also by Montenegrin tribes of Paљtrovici and Zacani, but he lost the town of Bar in June that year. In need of naval support, Stepan Vukcic sought help from King Alfons V of Aragon of from Republic of Genoa, archrivals of Venice. He failed to procure aid, however, and lost more towns to Venice in the process. In 1444, Stevan Crnojevic, leader of the rebellious Crnojevic family, betrayed Stepan Vukcic and joned the Venetians. Stepan renewed his efforts with Aragonese King and managed to secure an alliance.

<h3>Description</h3>
Close to the end of his life, Tvrtko II was scared of Ottoman progress in the Balkans and feld to Venice. He died in November 1443 without a male heir, but he outlived Hermann of Cilli who was supposed to inherit Bosnia in such case. With Hungary loosing a war against Ottoman Empire, Emperor Albrecht I was not in a position to press the claims of Hermann's successors. The only two remaining choices were the two sons of Stefan Ostoja, Tvrtko's predecessor, Radivoj and Tomas. Radivoj was an ally of Ottoman Turks and already showed his incapability by failing to gain influence in Bosnia despite Ottoman support. Before his death, King Tvrtko II named Tomas Ostojic, the more promising of the two brothers, his heir.

<h3>Description</h3>
With demise of Hungarian army at Varna, King Tomas found himself alone and surrounded by enemies. He searched for help across the Adriatic, asking Venice and the Pope for support. Pope Eugenius IV sent a bull making Tomas' father's marriage to Tomas' mother legitimate, which cleared Tomas of the status of bastard. Soon after, the Pope allowed Tomas to divorce his peasant wife. This gave no military support to Tomas, however, only repaired his reputation with the nobles and alienated him from the people of Bosnia.

<h3>Description</h3>
Duke Stepan Vukcic was facing defeats both against Venice and against King Tomas. King Tomas might have crushed Duke Stepan at the moment, but faced with the prospect of Aragonese inheritance and the idea that Alfons V might want to connect Hungary to Naples through Bonsia and Dalmatia, he sought peace with his most powerful Duke. It was made in May 1446 and crowned with Duke Stepan's marriage to Tomas' daughter Katarina.

<h3>Description</h3>
Ottoman Empire attacked Bosnia in March 1448. Having no hope of victory against the more powerful foe, Duke Stepan Vukcic betrayed King Tomas and joined forces with Despot of Serbia to defeat him near Srebrenica in September. To crown this victory, Stepan Vukcic declared himself Herceg of Saint Sava. Herceg is a title of Hungarian origin which he saw as higher than Duke, but he also adopted it to connect himself with the Orthodox cult of Saint Sava which was very popular among the lower class population. His lands are even today called Hercegovina after this title. King Tomas attempted to outmaneuver Herceg Stepan by asking the Pope to excommunicate him, even at the cost of giving all Stepan's lands to the church, but Rome was well aware that Stepan Vukcic was the greater supporter of Catholicism in Bosnia.

<h3>Description</h3>
The new Pope, Nicolaus V, supported King Tomas in hope of securing a stronger loyalty to Catholicism. In 1450, Pope Nicolaus V declared that anyone who fights in Tomas' army in defense and against his enemies will be absolved of all sins. As the enemies of King Tomas, he defined not only muslims but also schismatics and heretics (Orthodox and Krstjani). King Tomas, however, made a mistake and tried to use his new soldiers against his internal enemies, forcing many would-be conscripts to flee into lands of Herceg Stepan Vukcic.

<h3>Description</h3>
In December 1451, King Tomas signed a pact with Republic of Ragusa in Bobovac. In exchange for financial aid, King Tomas agreed to cede small parts of Herceg's lands to the Republic when he is defeated. The timing for an invasion was great as Herceg Stepan was greatly weakened by a conflict with his son Vladislav. However, it was delayed first by Ottoman arbiter sent by the Sultan, then by Venetian attack on Ragusa. King Tomas beat back the Venetian invaders and rescued Ragusa, but didn't take any actions against Herceg, fearful of Ottoman or Serbian invasion. General tension and loosing conflict with his own son forced Herceg Stepan to surrender in July 1453, dividing his lands between his sons, Princes Vladislav and Vlatko. In April 1454, Herceg Stepan also signed a white peace with Republic of Ragusa.
