<h3>Description</h3>
As Zimbabwe grew it outstripped its own reach. Various groups broke away from Great Zimbabwe to found their own competiting cities. One of the biggest of these was the Torwa, who migrated west to the Khami river around 1450. There they founded a city with more decorative art and more advanced drainage than Zimbabwe. Although their city was splendid, it was no longer a part of Great Zimbabwe.

<h3>Description</h3>
Great Zimbabwe itself was the largest city in southeastern Africa, with over 18,000 people at its height. Such a large city required huge amounts of food, food that was sent to the capital from surrounding settlments. One after another, settlements along the fringes of the state began to break away, many of them to the northern Mwenemutapa Empire, that had itself broken away from Zimbabwe around 1400. As Mwenemutapa gained control of the valuable Swahili trade, trading goods from afar became scarcer and dearer. Gold, which was used mainly to buy overseas goods to appease the nobility, was now almost worthless. Sensing the end, people began to desert the city of Great Zimbabwe.

<h3>Description</h3>
Around 1400 the Karanga people broke off from Zimbabwe to found a trading city near the Zambezi river. Their leader was given the title Mwene Mutapa, 'one who explores', and this became the name of the state as it began to absorb other Zimbabwean settlements. Over the next century Mwenemutapa grew until it controlled the northern half of the Zimbabwean Plateau and had gained control over the valuable Swahili trade. Around this time the Portuguese were attempting to take control of the Swahili coast and they settled along the Zambezi, trading with the Mwenemutapa and ignoring Great Zimbabwe. As Zimbabwe itself had done to the Mapungubwe, so now the Mwenemutapa were doing to them. The Mwenemutapa continued to grow, gradually becoming the dominant power in the region. The Portuguese were disappointed with the gold they found, however, and turned their attentions to the Americas instead.

<h3>Description</h3>
Chincanda, chief of a Maravi warband that had been granted permission to settle in the Zambesi River Valley in 1597, revolted in 1599. The Paramount Chief of Monomotapa, Gatse Lucere, requested aid from the Portuguese settlements down river from Chincanda to suppress the revolt. While initially successful in quelling the revolt, Gatse Lucere was over-zealous in protecting his own position and prompted continued revolts by various Karanga chieftancies for most of his reign.

<h3>Description</h3>
Plagued by continuous revolts, Gatse Lucere, Paramount Chief of Monomotapa, requested aid from the Portuguese. As partial recompense he offered title to all the silver mines in Karangaland. There weren't any, but the Portuguese didn't know that. Nonetheless this set the stage for increased Portuguese influence in the area.

The death of Gatse Lucere, Paramount Chief of Monomotapa, without a clearly-designated successor in 1623 started a civil war as various chiefs pressed their claims. Inhambo, later called Caprasine for 'the King who flees', was initially successful, but he was overthrown by Mavura in 1629.

<h3>Description</h3>
Changamire Dombo was a minor Karanga chieftain who first raided north into Portuguese-controlled territory in 1684. He defeated an invasion by the Monomotapa the following year and was able to drive them and the Portuguese from the entire Zimbabwean Plateau by 1695 where he established the Rozvi Empire.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1631 Caprasine, the former Paramount Chief of Monomotapa, organized a large uprising against the Portuguese in coordination with the Karanga tribesmen alienated by Mavura. He was initially quite successful as the Portuguese were totally taken by surprise and many traders who had flocked to Monomotapa after Mavura had submitted were killed. He also attacked the Portuguese settlement at Quelimane. However the Karanga chieftains had failed to stockpile firearms or to prepare defensive positions and Diogo Sousa de Meneses was able to crush them easily after he was appointed Captain of Mozambique in 1632.

<h3>Description</h3>
Great Zimbabwe was its own worst enemy. As the state grew, new settlements appeared and Zimbabwean culture spread. After more than a century, these new settlements were so far away from Great Zimbabwe that they were more or less autonomous, and some took advantage of this to break away from Zimbabwe. Most of these settlements were small, but some were more powerful. Great Zimbabwe itself was the largest city in southeastern Africa, with over 18,000 people at its height. Such a large city required huge amounts of food, food that was sent to the capital from surrounding settlments. With each loss, less and less tribute reached its way to Great Zimbabwe to feed the people.

<h3>Description</h3>
Like other Bantu people the Shona of Zimbabwe counted wealth in cattle, not gold. For centuries the Shona had led their cattle up to the plateau in summer when the mosquitos swarmed, then led them down in winter to graze. But as Great Zimbabwe grew, its herds of cattle increased significantly, leading to shortages of grazing land that became critical in times of drought. Because the King of Zimbabwe was also its spiritual leader he was blamed when Mwari did not bring rain, setting off a political crisis as well.
