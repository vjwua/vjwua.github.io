During Serbian campaign to recapture the towns in Zeta that were taken by Venice after death of the last Balsic, most Montenegrin and Albanian tribes fought on the side of Serbian Despot. Montenegrin tribe of Pastrovici and Albanian tribes of Tuzi and Pamalioti, however, sold their services as mercenaries to the Republic of Venice.

<h3>Description</h3>
Having now fought each other for 3 years, the victory of the Venetians under Filippo Arcelli and Taddeo d'Este over the Hungarians was enough for Sigismund to ask for peace with the following conditions, eastern Friuli and his Dalmatian provinces lost in the war will remain under Venice, while Venetian held Croatian lands will be returned to Hungary. It took Venice another 16 years to get Sigismund to acknowledge that the 10th century ownership given to Venice for Dalmatia by Byzantium was justified.

<h3>Description</h3>
Doge Tommaso Mocenigo summoned members of the Signoria to his deathbed in order to leave them with some final thoughts. The Doge pointed out that they had managed to reduce the national debt, increase income from trade, and increase the size of their merchant fleet. He prophesied that if they continued in this wise, that Venice would prosper, but that if they did not refrain, as if from fire, from taking what belongs to others or making unjust wars, that Venice would see nothing but strife, and war, and loss. The Doge said that where now you are masters, war would cause Venice to become the slaves of their men-at-arms and their captains.

<h3>Description</h3>
Mercenary and auxiliary troops are both useless and dangerous. If any Prince bases his state upon mercenaries, he will never succeed in making it stable or secure... a point which should require little emphasis since the ruin of Italy is the result of having for many years now put her trust in mercenary armies-to the point where they have led her into slavery and ignominy-Machiavelli, The Prince, Chapter XII. Carmagnola was one of the most noted mercenaries, or Condotierri, of his day. He faithfully served Milan for years until he felt he was being replaced by the young Francesco Sforza. Carmagnola, so named for the place of his birth in the Piedemonte, promptly offered his services to Venice.

<h3>Description</h3>
Once elected, the new Doge Francesco Foscari immediately faced a difficult political situation for Venice. Visconti was pushing towards the lower Po Valley. The Republic was becoming more and more alarmed by the ambitious plan of Visconti to submit the weak Lordships in Northern Italy. The Milanese attacks on Romagna and the presumptive defection of the great condottiero Carmagnola from the Milanese troops definitely pressed the war-like tempered doge to give full support to Florence who invoked a League as an attempt to stop the Milanese hegemonic threat towards south. The new political situation gave Venice the opportunity to expand in the Milanese ducal territories with the support of her allies who feared the Milanese expansionism above all. Venice could assure its own inland space, the Terraferma, important for military security of inland trade routes with northern Europe and for food supply lines.

</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
Spices, and pepper in particular, from the Orient were carried by Arab merchants and unloaded at Jiddah, which the Mamluks had control of. From here it was shipped to Egypt, and offered for sale to the Venetians, who dominated the spice trade from Egypt by this time. There were no other alternative spice routes to Europe, as Cyprus was controlled by the Mamluks. In 1426 sultan Barsbay decided to make pepper a royal monopoly by increasing the price of pepper, and then again in 1428 and 1430. The Venetians had a choice of paying up, or giving up the centerpiece of their trade. They paid. The Sultan's demands went up and up in the 1430s, and his successor continued the extortion.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1430 Murad II's Turkish forces besieged Thessalonica, which the Venetians had held since 1430. Amazingly, Venice was able to break the siege and retain Thessalonica, plus the entire Macedonian hinterland. Venice's purse and prestige were both puffed up.

Carmagnola suffered from ill health due to wounds received in the service of Milan. However, this fact may not be sufficient to explain the dilatory way in which he conducted warfare while serving Venice. Furthermore, Carmagnola was suspected of treason due to the regular and frequent communications he had with his former employer, Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan. In 1432, Carmagnola was tricked into coming to Venice, and then put on trial for his life...

<h3>Description</h3>
After the death of Giovanna of Anjou without natural heirs, a war of succession for the Kingdom of Naples broke out between the two claimants, Renй of Anjou and Alfons of Aragon, both designated heirs in two different times by Giovanna. Filippo Maria Visconti of Milan, also Signore of Genoa, preoccupied with the increasing Aragonese influence in the Mediterranean sea trade routes as much as in the Italian peninsula, decided to support the Angevins. Alfons of Aragon was defeated and captured by a Genovese fleet at the battle of Ponza in 1435. Transferred to Milan, Alfons succeeded in gaining Visconti's favour to his cause against the French Angevins. He convinced Filippo Maria that a French presence in Italy could be against the interests of Milan since the House of Orlйans had never hidden its dynastic claims on the Duchy of Milan. But Genoa, a bitter rival of Aragon during centuries of dispute over Sardinia, Corsica, and the control of the Western Mediterranean trade, was appalled by Visconti's sudden change of sides, and immediately asked for admission in the Venetian-Florentine league against her former suzerain.

<h3>Description</h3>
Over the period of twenty years, a struggle between Venice and Hungary weakened the Hungarian influence in Dalmatia. In 1409, Ladislaus of Naples sold his rights over Dalmatia to Venice for 100,000 Ducats. Venice gradually took over most of Dalmatia by 1420. In 1437, Sigismund recognized Venetian rule over Dalmatia in return for 100,000 Ducats. The city of Omis yielded to Venice in 1444, and only Dubrovnik preserved its freedom.

<h3>Description</h3>
Though the people of Venice generally remained orthodox Roman Catholics, the state of Venice was notable for its freedom from religious fanaticism and it enacted not a single execution for religious heresy during the Counter-Reformation. This apparent lack of zeal contributed to Venice's frequent conflicts with the Papacy. Venice was threatened with the interdict on a number of occasions and twice suffered its imposition. The second, most famous, occasion was on April 27, 1509, by order of Pope Julius II. Another earlier Interdict was on the death of the last of the Da Polenta family, Ostasio III, who was ousted by the Republic of Venice in 1441 with aid by the Romagnan people, the city was then annexed to the Venetian territories. Other Romagnan cities followed in the next 40 years, Rimini, Cervia and Faenza. Ravenna the biggest city was ruled by Venice until 1509, when the area was invaded in the course of the Italian Wars.

</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
Several peace treaties were stipulated between Visconti and the other Italian states, amongst them Venice and Florence, forming the anti-Visconti League: as main condition the Milanese Duke had to abandon his ambitions to rule in Northern Italy. But war actually didn't and couldn't stop, Visconti soon invaded Papal States with the intention to punish the Pope Eugenius V, former Venetian Cardinal, for plotting with the League against him. Facing a new and stronger League, whose troops were commanded by Francesco Sforza, Filippo Maria succeeded in asking the condottiero to mediate with the League-confederates for an immediate peace. In exchange for that service, Sforza married Visconti's daughter Bianca Maria. Since Visconti hadn't yet any direct male heir, Sforza would be in condition to claim the throne at Visconti's death. In the treaty signed in Cremona in 1441 Venice obtained the suzerainty over the cities of Brescia, Bergamo and Ravenna while Visconti had to confirm the independence of Genoa and to give up definitely his ambitious plan of a reborn Lombard Kingdom in Northern Italy.

<h3>Description</h3>
Francesco Foscari, the longest lasting doge in Venice history, pursued aggressive policies, that although successful in the short term, due to the acquisition of Brescia and Bergamo from Milan, engaged Venice in never ending wars in Italy that emptied the treasury and caused inflation. Foscari had powerful enemies that were economically harmed by his policies, and the conduct of his only son Jacopo opened his flank to their attack. Jacopo Foscari was tried by the Council of Ten three times between 1444 and 1456 for accepting bribes, murder and treason. He was treated with relative leniency given the seriousness of the accusations, in part because the worst between them, that of murdering a respected senator, could not be proved. He was first banished from the city, then exiled in Crete and finally imprisoned for a year, before dying in exile in 1457.

Following the loss of the services of Francesco Sforza, the military forces of Venice suffered a loss of professionalism and morale. Furthermore, the Serrenissma, or Serene Republic, seemed to feel that its future lay with the sea. Many Venetians felt that their colonies and possession on terra firma may prove to be more trouble than they were worth.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1447 Duke Filippo Maria Visconti died without a male heir in his succession to the throne. As a result of this the city of Milan proclaimed the Republic giving the high military command to Francesco Sforza on the purpose to stop Venice from the eastern borders profiting from the Milanese crisis by expanding her dominions beyond Adda River. After 2 years and half of life, isolated and surrounded by the unfaithful Sforza, who in the meanwhile and with the support of Venice turned against the city of Milan aiming at the ducal throne, the Ambrosian Republic eventually ceased to exist. Brought to severe famine the citizenship of Milan was forced to surrender to the condottiero and accept him as their new Duke. As soon as Sforza proclaimed himself successor of Visconti to the throne of Milan and the Holy Roman Emperor didn't acknowledge him the ducal investiture, the war of succession inevitably began. Encouraged by that and as to continued her war of conquest Venice tried to renew her old alliance with Florence. But Florence was now ruled by Cosimo de Medici, a Sforza's friend, who instead resolved to support the condottiero in order to check Venice and her expansionist policy in Terraferma.

<h3>Description</h3>
Fra Mauro was a monk of the Camaldolese order and, in all probability, head of a cartographic workshop in the lagoon of Venice. He intensely query merchants, sailors and other travelers about the geography of their voyages. With this knowledge, the most detailed world map of the time was completed. Fra Mauro has included nearly 3000 inscriptions, text and pictographs. He departed from religious based geography by depicting the map in the form of a planisphere. It quite accurate depicts Asia, Africa and Europe, including Greenland and Japan. At least two maps were commissioned. One was intended for the Portuguese King Alfonso V, along with a letter to his uncle, Prince Henry the Navigator, from the Doge of Venice, who encouraged him to continue his research. This copy disappeared sometime after 1494. The other map was drawn for the Signoria of Venice and has survived to this day.

<h3>Description</h3>
During the war of succession in Milan, all the belligerent nations were brought to exhaustion of money and troops. Francesco Sforza, ruler of Milan and Venice, the chief state of the league confederates, who was more and more threatened by the advancing Ottomans in her eastern Mediterranean territories, convened a cease-fire while a bilateral treaty was hastily signed in Lodi on 7 April 1454. With that treaty Sforza was legitimated Duke of Milan. Without even being called for, Florence and the Pope had no choice then to endorse the treaty. The King of Naples, being a rightful claimant on the ducal throne reluctantly joined the alliance under the condition to keep Genoa out of it. Intended 'infra terminos italicos', that treaty showed the objective impossibility for all the Italian major powers (specifically Milan, Tuscany, Venice, Naples and Papal States) to prevail upon each other in the struggle for the hegemony in Italy and that the better solution was to come to terms with each other. That would have also avoided the practice of very expensive and pointless wars in the next future. Although the treaty actually played a minor part in Italian balance of powers and so won't be able to avoid future wars of aggression from inside as well from outside Italy, the post-Lodi era historically represented a period of relative peace in which the figurative arts definitively flourished in the whole Italian peninsula, as well as economy and trade and, last but not the least, the skills and tricks of the art of diplomacy.

<h3>Description</h3>
Following the death of Jacopo, his last remaining son, in exile, Francesco Foscari, a man of 84 years of age, was very much affected. The political party opposed to him accused him of neglecting his duties, something that had not been a problem in the previous 150 years, where all Doges had died of old age. He was further humiliated when the Council of Ten forced his resignation, taking from him the symbols of power and expelling him from the Ducal Palace. Two days after his successor was elected, he died. The discontent between the venetians for this unnecessary mistreatment was so big that the Council of Ten confiscated the corpse from the family and dressed him in the dogal garments for his state funeral, and had his successor and opponent, Pasquale Malipiero, walk behind in senatorial dress. Despite the masquerade, a year later, the High Council passed a law limiting the power of the Council of Ten in matters regarding the Doge and his provisions, and publicly reprimanded the Council.

<h3>Description</h3>
Turkish control of the strategic Morean peninsula was necessary for Mehmed's own project of tackling Italy in time. Therefore, the great sultan personally led campaigns in 1458 and again in 1460 that extinguished the last remnants of Byzantine sovereignty in the Morea. The definitive annexation of the peninsula by Turkey deprived the Christian west of its most valuable base for any anti-Turkish crusade. Venetian involvement in the Morea was always present and due to the anarchy prevailing in the Morea prior to 1423, made Venice decide to acquire the entire peninsula. Many meetings between Venetian envoys and envoys representing emperor Manuel and Theodore II of Morea came to nothing. Although the Venetian republic failed to annex the Morea in 1423, it strengthened and enlarged its valuable Morean colonies. From 1423, Venice acquired the castle of Grisi midway between Modon and Coron and also purchased Port-de Jonc to go with its previous purchases of Lepanto, Patras and Messenia. With the fall of Morea, Venice decided to step up its claim on the peninsula.

<h3>Description</h3>
The only significant sources of silver left operating in Europe in early 1420s were mines at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Novo Brdo in soutern Serbia, and they shipped most of their production through the Venetian ports and fortresses that controlled the coast of Dalmatia, with an average outflow of about 20 tonnes of silver a year. As the Bosnian mines declined in the 1430s, the stage was set for a financial disaster, completed when the Turks overran the Serbian silver mines in 1455, and in 1460 captured the last Bosnian mine. The last Venetian silver grosso was minted in 1462. On 17th March 1464 Venice sent all the city's spare cash with the galleys to trade with Syria, leaving nothing in the city treasury but small and debased coins. The bullion crisis reached a point where trade was strangled. Compounding the problem, a genuine fear that creditors would be unable to find money to pay bills led to a restriction for credit. Such fears were real: several Venetian banks failed, and so did the Strozzi bank of Florence, the second largest in the city. Even the smallest of small change became scarce. But the crisis didn't last long. In the late 1450s, Martin Claus of Gotha solved the problem of the flooded silver mines of Saxony, just as Europe ran out of currency. The old mines quickly re-opened, and new discoveries were made in the Harz Mountains (the Erzgebirge). Thereafter, Saxon and Bohemian mining resumed at full scale from mines such as Kutnб Hora, Freiberg, and Rammelsberg, and new mines were opened in other regions: at Schneeberg in Saxony and at Schwats in the Tirol, which was discovered in 1448. New supplies of bullion reached European economies, beginning in the 1460s, but especially in the 1470s and 1480s.

<h3>Description</h3>
The 'Monte Vecchio', was a system of forced loans and bonds, it was evident by 1453 that this traditional system of financing wars would no longer work. In 1463, levies were moderated and regularized and made more equitable. These new series of bonds, called the 'Monte Nuovo' had assurance of regularly paying 5 percent, this seemed so good that the Monte Nuovo were bought voluntarily by both Venetian and foreign investors.

<h3>Description</h3>
The independent attitude of the Republic in matters ecclesiastical is illustrated in the position occupied by the Inquisition at Venice in 1468. When the Pope, with a view to crushing the Albigensian and Patarinian heresies, endeavoured to establish everywhere in Italy the Dominican Inquisition, the Republic resisted its introduction into Venice. The State charged itself to discover heretics, who when caught were examined by the Patriarch, the Bishop of Castello, or any other Venetian Ordinary. The examining Court was confined to a return of fact. It was called on to state whether the examinee was or was not guilty of heresy. Punishment was reserved to the secular authority. This arrangement did not satisfy the Court of Rome, an Inquisitor was appointed by the Pope, but he required the Doge's exequatur before he could act, and a board was created of three Venetian nobles, to sit as assessors to the Holy Office. Their duty was to guard the rights of Venetian citizens against ecclesiastical encroachment, including the non-interference in religious matters within the colonies, without their presence and their sanction no act of the Holy Office was valid in Venice. The Inquisition in Venice was certainly no sanguinary Office, thanks no doubt in a large degree to the independent attitude of the State, which insisted upon the presence of lay assessors at every trial.

<h3>Description</h3>
Venice's staunchest ally against the turks, Skanderbeg, the Albanian 'Athlete of Christendom', died of malaria in 1468. In his mountains he had held his own against the fury of the Ottoman army even when it was led by the sultan in person. He bequeathed his country and his cause to Venice as 'the most faithful and valiant of his allies', but Venice was able to defend only a few major Albanian cities while turkish armies occupied the others.

<h3>Description</h3>
Having learned from the coin crisis of 1465, the Venetians began minting pure copper coins for everyday use in 1473. The coins were good coinage, that is, they were worth almost exactly what the copper in them was worth. The Venetians were able to do this because new copper mines had opened in the Alps and Carpathians, and Venice was well placed to trade in the metal.

<h3>Description</h3>
Venice's most striking success in rising to the Turkish challenge was its expansion of the industrial output of the main base. In 1473 the senate ordered the addition and inclusion of the ghetto 'casting foundry', to the newest Arsenal. This enlargement could construct and store reserves of ships, cannons and other military arms. In additon, manpower in the arsenal reached 6000 employed men for peace or military duty. The elite of Venetian infantry were drawn from the ranks of the Arsenalotti, the highly skilled and well-paid craftsmen of the Arsenal.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Treviso Arithmetic, or Arte dell'Abbaco, is a Venetian mathematics textbook written by an anonymous teacher in Treviso, Italy in 1478. The Treviso Arithmetic is the earliest known printed mathematics book in the West, and one of the first printed European textbooks dealing with a science. The Treviso Arithmetic is a practical book intended for self study and for use in Venetian trade. It is written in the Venetian language and communicated knowledge to a large population. It helped to end the monopoly on mathematical knowledge and gave important information to the middle class. It was not written for a large audience, but intended to teach mathematics of everyday currency in Italy. The Treviso became one of the first mathematics books that were written for the expansion of human knowledge. It gave opportunity for the common person to learn the art of computation instead of only a privileged few. The Treviso Arithmetic provided an early example of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system and computational algorithms.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Pope had sought Venice's help against the King of Naples, leaving her a free hand against Ferrara. He subsequently became alarmed by Venice's success, however, and while Florence and Milan intervened in Ferrara's favour, Sixtus IV had recourse to an interdict in order to stop Venice. At the peace of 1484 Venice was allowed to retain 'the Polesine', which she had conquered.

<h3>Description</h3>
The presence of Charles VIII of France in the Kingdom of Naples scared the Italian princes, who had in a certain way permitted the French King to achieve his goal of settling there almost undisturbed. Venice and Florence were worried about a French hegemony in the peninsula. French military presence wasn't limited to Southern Italy but also to villages of Tuscany and the Papal States, which previously surrendered to Charles VIII in his march towards Naples, strategically located to grant the French military supply line. The Pope, who previously granted the French King military access through the Papal territories and consented his stay in Rome, felt in jeopardy as much as to refuse Charles VIII being proclaimed King of Naples. Also King Ferdinand of Aragon couldn't accept the French presence in a Kingdom where he instead, in spite of Alfons V's testament which assigned Naples to the other Trastamara branch, could be the one to have claims there. The position of Naples was also important for the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean. The Duke of Milan, who decisively affected Charles VIII's decision to settle in Naples, was now alarmed by the presence of French reserve troops deployed in the county of Asti, very close to Milan and at the order of the Duke of Orlйans, who had dynastical claims to the Milanese throne. So Venice, Milan, the Pope, Spain and even the Holy Roman Empire (so firmly opposed to the French expansionism in Italy as to join any Anti-French alliance available) consequently formed the Anti-French league in Venice on 31 March 1495. Florence preferred to stay out because of her internal problems caused by Charles VIII's passage and decided to support France instead. Having heard about those arrangements and fearing that the confederates would isolate his army in Italy, Charles VIII decided to return to France for reinforcements leaving his regent in Naples. He had to move his army quickly through the Apennines as to reach the Alps and then safety, but the presence of heavy artilleries and carriages transporting the big loot he accumulated across Italy, slowed his march down. Only at Fornovo on the Taro River, in the Po Valley, Charles VIII finally faced the army of the confederates. Despite having lost all the carriages, he managed to reach the Alps gaining from his expedition to Italy nothing but his army decimated by epidemies.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1499, Girolamo Priuli picked up news on the Rialto of a Portuguese fleet's arrival in India. The Senate believed that the new-found route of the Portuguese would never amount to anything. Priuli went to the other extreme and prophesied the new route would enable the Portuguese to sell spices at a fraction of the cost the Venetians paid. They ordered an secret embassy sent to the Mameluk Sultan to try and negotiate that duties on spices and Indian goods be lowered to make the Venetians competitive with the Portuguese. When the Sultan refused they then agreed to supply the timber for the fleet that the Sultan wanted to build to fight the Portuguese. Disappointingly much of the convoy carrying the timber was captured by the Knights Hospitaller or lost in a storm enroute.

<h3>Description</h3>
Since early times, the Serenissima has always been threatened by the silting up of the lagoon because of the negative effect it could have had on the city of Venice, whose safety and prosperity were indissolubly linked to the existence of the lagoon around her. Since XIIth century plain water-courses were embanked in order to limit the erosion and the consequent transport of sediments to the lagoon, but these works did not bring the expected results and it was therefore decided to face the problem radically deflecting the rivers that flew into the lagoon. In 1501 for that particular purpose the High Council formed a committee of three 'Savi alle Acque' (The Water Supervisors). Starting from 1551 the first river to be deflected was the Brenta, then the Bacchiglione, the Piave, the Sile, the Adige and even the Po River, all of them potentially dangerous to the status quo of the lagoon. During the next two centuries to some extent all these rivers were deflected from their old courses to the seaside, outside the lagoon. The silting up of the lagoon was actually slowed down, but at the same time both the erosion and the withdrawing of the salt-marshes increased.

<h3>Description</h3>
Venice, shorn suddenly of her commercial hegemony, bereft of friends or allies, under continual and increasing threat from the Turks in the East and the princes of Europe in the West, it seemed to her that her only long-term hope of survival lay in building up a broad mainland bulwark. Thus, when the dispossessed lords of cities that had fallen to Cesare Borgia sought refuge in Venetian territory, she had immediately offered them sympathy and shelter. And when, seeing Cesare facing a crisis in his fortunes, these nobles made determined and more or less simultaneous bids to reinstate themselves, she gave them her active support - always provided that they would accept her as their overlord and govern in her name. By the end of 1503 the banner of St Mark was already floating over Russi and Forlimpopoli, Rimini, Cervia, and Faenza. - John Norwich, A History of Venice, New York, 1989. Taking possession of Rimini, Faenza, and a number of other cities, Venice strengthened her position below the Po River where the city of Ravenna worked as strategic outpost since 1431. But Julius II, having secured his own control of the Papal armies by arresting and imprisoning il Valentino, quickly moved to re-establish Papal control over the Romagna (since it was amongst the territories ceded to the Holy See by Pepin III in 752 in what constituted the original Papal States) by demanding that Venice return the cities she had seized. Venice refused to surrender the cities, although willing to acknowledge Papal sovereignty over them and pay an annual tribute to the Holy See. After having unsuccessfully induced Venice to abandon Romagna by means of a Papal bull, the resolute Julius II began to look for allies. Only in September 1504 at Blois where Louis XII of France stipulated a treaty with which he renounced his claims over Naples in favour of Spain for the investiture of the Duchy of Milan, at the presence of the Emperor and the Archduke of Burgundy Philippe le Beau, the Pope let them include a secret paragraph by which the signatories would have allied against Venice. In facts Julius II did not possess sufficient forces to fight Venice even if for the next two years he recovered a few small towns in Romagna and managed to bring under Papal rule, Bologna and Perugia, both only nominally subject to the church and also to re-establish the order in Rome by means of political marriages between his family, the Della Rovere, and the rival factions of Colonna and Orsini.

<h3>Description</h3>
First constructed in 1228, the Fondego dei Tedeschi was a combined palazzo, warehouse, and restricted living quarters for its population, in this case mainly Germanic merchants from cities such as Nuremberg and Augsburg. The building was rebuilt between 1505 and 1508, after its destruction in a fire. The Palazzo outer facade was painted by famous artists Titian and Giorgione, but their work has not survived the Venetian climate. Its architecture is typical of the cinquecento Veneto Gothic style. Like the Fondaco dei Turchi, the German merchants arrived shortly after the building was originally constructed in the thirteen century, dealt in gold and silver ( from northern Europe ) trade at the Venetian auctions and stayed until the Napoleonic occupation of 1797.

<h3>Description</h3>
Since 1495, Venice had been holding the main ports of Apulia despite Aragonese claims to have them back. With the French invasion of Milan, Venice had acquired Milanese territories east of the Adda River, and upon the fall of Cesare Borgia had also acquired Rimini, Faenza and Ravenna, against the will of Pope Julius II. The Venetians also held Veneto and Friuli, on which Maximilian of Habsburg had imperial claims. In late 1507 Maximilian announced his intention to travel to Italy to receive the imperial investiture from the Pope himself, and in early 1508 he assembled a big army to escort him down to Rome. He requested free passage through Venetian territories, but was told that he would be allowed passage only without his army. Enraged at the answer, Maximilian attacked Venice, but this decision proved unwise: Venice not only routed the imperial army but also seized the imperial cities of Trieste, Gorz and Fiume. A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure, forcing Maximilian to conclude a humiliating three-year truce. With Pope Julius II's assent, Maximilian took the title of 'Emperor-elect', thus breaking the century-old custom that the Holy Roman Emperor had to be crowned by the Pope. Shortly afterward, Venice provided a pretext for war by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza. The Emperor, the King of France and Ferdinand of Aragon gathered in Cambrai in December 1508 to sign a treaty which seemed to be a defensive alliance against the Turk. In reality they meant to form a league to attack Venice and deprive the Serenissima of most of her mainland territories. Pope Julius II, after a renewed Venetian refusal to give the Romagna lands back to the Papacy, ratified the treaty and at the same time proceeded to excommunicate all Venetian citizens. Ferrara and Mantua, each with separate claims to territories held by Venice, joined the league as well. In April 1509 military operations started, and a month later French troops decimated one of the two Venetian armies at the battle of Agnadello. Even though in August 1509 Venice managed to eliminate Mantua from the war, she still faced the collapse of her strategic position and had by February 24, 1510 to accept the papal demands on the cities she had occupied in Romagna. However, Pope Julius II was still not satisfied and demanded that the war be prosecuted until Venice conceded control over their church to the Pope and compensated him for his expenses. The Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity. This opportunity presented itself shortly afterward.

</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
In spite of their victories in Northern Italy, the French troops were forced to abandon the battlefield both because of financial reasons and because after the successful battle of Ravenna the Emperor was withdrawing troops and would have joined the holy league formed by Papal States, Spain, England and Venice with the help of Swiss troops hired by Pope Julius II himself and led into war by the Bishop of Sion, Mathias Schiner. Thence the decision to withdraw from Milan. Julius II recovered Ravenna, Bologna and the rest of the Romagna, while his commander, the Duke of Urbino, easily occupied Reggio and Modena, though Alfonso d'Este refused any settlement that would deprive him of Ferrara. After having chased out the French from Italy, the congress of allies which met at Mantua in August made over to the Pope Parma and Piacenza, to which he had at best a shadowy claim. The Emperor and Fernando would have been glad to give Milan to their grandson Charles but the Swiss were in possession and, supported by the Pope, made their will good. The duchy was given to Ercole Massimiliano Sforza, the elder son of Ludovico. The Venetian claims were left unsettled with Brescia still held out and the Swiss claiming Cremona and the Ghiara d'Adda for the duchy. And more, the Emperor demanded Vicenza and Verona. Florence, who in 1509 had ended her long war by the recovery of Pisa, was punished for her support of France by the restoration of the Medici. Entering Milan, Ercole Massimiliano Sforza received the keys to the city from the Swiss soldiers, who promised to protect the duchy of Milan and to help the Duke in sending to him all the troops he would need. The Duke granted them the acquisition of the ducal territories Ticino and Valtellina, the most important accesses to the Alpine passes. Genoa drew back its allegiance to the French King, who in 1506 harshly repressed a local rebellion that broke out owing to the decision taken by the French governor to grant privileges to the nobilty. But Julius II made also a treaty with his late ally, Maximilian, against Venice. The emperor was to support the Lateran council to oppose that one proclaimed by Louis XII in Pisa and to hand over Modena to the Pope, while Julius II was to join in compelling Venice to give up the fiefs which the Emperor claimed since Cambrai and to use on behalf of his new ally also the always convincing 'spiritual weapons'. When this treaty was made public, it had only the effect to drive Venice to side with France.

<h3>Description</h3>
Around X century the Jews who came to Venice were usually merchants and moneylenders. Until the end of XIII century they weren't even allowed to settle in the city with the exception of the island of Spinalunga, later known as Giudecca. In 1394 only the Jews who were not moneylenders were allowed to remain in the city, the others were expelled. However they were forced to certain restrictions, like wearing various markings on their clothing to identify themselves as Jews (generally yellow badges or hats, changed in red in 1500). Jews weren't allowed to own lands and build synagogues, they were even forced to attend Christian services or become baptized and often subjet to anti-Jewish aggressions. Following the expulsion from Spain and Portugal in 1492 lots of Jewish immigrants came to Venice and decisions had to be taken about whether Jews should be allowed to remain in the city. On 29 March 1516 the Council of Ten decreed to let the Jews remain, however their residence would be confined to Ghetto Nuovo (New Ghetto), a small, dirty island of Cannaregio sestiere (a quartier in Venice) named after the Venetian word 'Gheto' meaning 'casting' for the iron foundries located there in those centuries and pronunced with a hard 'g' by the German Jews, who first settled there. The area was then isolated by wide surrounding canals and linked to the rest of the city by means of two bridges, which were closed by Christian guards at night and during certain Christian festivals, when all Jews were required to stay away. In Venice Jews were only permitted to work at pawn shops, act as moneylenders, trade in second hand goods or practice medicine and in order to leave the Ghetto at day they had to wear distinguishing marks or hats. In 1541, Jewish immigrations from the Levant, Spain and Portugal increased the population of the Ghetto so that, even if many six-story 'skyscrapers' had been built because of the lack of space, the quarter was enlarged to the neighbouring area, the Ghetto Vecchio (Old Ghetto). Despite the poor living conditions, Jewish community life in the Ghettp continued to grow, centered around Jewish rituals, customs and celebrations in synagogues built on buildings' top floors in respect of local laws which forbade synagogues in separate buildings. After 1630, when the Jewish population of Venice reached 5,000 inhabitants, the Ghetto's boundaries extended to the Ghetto Nuovissimo.

<h3>Description</h3>
Gasparo Contarini, politician and Venetian diplomat expressed the approval which surrounded Venice's constitutional arrangements, not only among the Venetians but throughout Italy and in foreign lands, where men were astonished at Venice's greatness, her long independence, her resistance to Italy's tragic loss of freedom and, not least, her emerging unscathed from the war against the League of Cambrai. In his work Contarini suggested that the secret of Venice's greatness lay in the co-existence of Aristotle's three types of government, monarchy, oligarchy and democracy.

<h3>Description</h3>
The schiavona was a renaissance sword that became popular in Italy in 16th and 17th century. Stemming from the 16th century sword of the Venetian Doge guard, the name came from the fact that the guards consisted largely of Dalmatian Slavs (Schiavoni). Classified as a true broadsword this war sword had a wider blade than its contemporary infantry rapiers. The Schiavona was basket hilted and double edged. During the 17th century, due to the trade with northern Italy, the Schiavona won a huge popularity in all other European armies. Later fitted with a long blade, it became the favourite sword of all the heavy cavalry.

<h3>Description</h3>
It was time for Venice to reconsider her position. Her alliance with France was an increasing liability, particularly since the recent Spanish victories over the French. To gain future Spanish aid against the Turk, a treaty was signed that outlined, the payment of 200,000 ducats by Venice to keep all the former Imperial territories held at that time by Venice and each party agreed to come to the defence of the other unless the aggressor was the Pope. The treaty was also signed by Francesco II Sforza whom the Emperor had reestablished on the throne of Milan.

<h3>Description</h3>
Antonio Pigafetta belonged to a rich family of Vicenza. In his youth he studied astronomy, geography and cartography. He served on board the galleys of the order of St. John at the beginning of 16th century. In 1519 he accompanied the Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Chieregati, to Spain where he was presented to the Emperor Carlos I (V). There he heard of the trip of Magellan and negotiated to be admitted as a paying passenger, a supernumerary. In spite of initial difficulties with Magellan, he managed to gain his confidence and served as a chronicler and cartographer for him. During the trip, Pigafetta collected information about geography, the climate, the flora, the fauna and the inhabitants of the visited places. His meticulous notes were to serve as invaluable documents to future explorers and cartographers, mainly due to their focus on nautical and linguistic data. In the battle at Mactan, Philippines, in which Magellan was killed, Pigafetta also was hurt. Nevertheless, he managed to recover and was among the 18 on board the Victoria who accompanied Juan Sebastiбn Elcano in his return to Spain. After reaching port in Sanlъcar de Barrameda (Cadiz) in September of 1522, three years after his departure, he recollected his experiences in 'Relations of the First Round-the-world Trip', composed in Italian and published in Venice. After that voyage Pigafetta returned to Italy where he died in his native city in 1534.

<h3>Description</h3>
In late 1529, according to the treaty stipulated in Barcelona a few months before, Charles V came to Bologna to meet the Pope. Princes and ambassadors of all Italian states came to this encounter with the intention to confirm their allegiance to the Empire. Charles V used his strengthened political influence to definitely settle the Italian balance of powers and the conflicts between the Italian minors that deceitfully used to switch sides between France and the Empire. According to Mercurino da Gattinara's advices Charles V granted independence to all the imperial fiefs and, with the mediation of Pope Clemens VII, even to Francesco Sforza who was reinstated in his duchy in spite of his joining the league of Cognac. Pope Clemens VII instead, receiving the territory of Parma was to renounce his claims to Modena and Ferrara and to promise to arrange for a Concile in the next future to discuss about the Reform of the Church. Settled the political affairs in the peninsula, Charles was crowned by Pope Clement VII King of Italy on 22 February 1530 and Holy Roman Emperor two day later, in two solemn ceremonies arranged in Bologna. The imperial crown was a really big gift for his 30th birthday: Charles V resulted, in facts, the last Holy Roman Emperor in history to be personally crowned by the Pope.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Venetian Republic had an almost ridiculously complex series of checks and balances to ensure fair elections and discourage power resting with a single man. Normal business passed through normal channels, but the collegio could refer urgent matters to the Council of Ten which had extraordinary powers to cut red-tape and by-pass the slow moving senate. The Council of Ten (17 in reality, as it included the Doge and his Signoria, or cabinet) was authorized to act on its own initiative, make payments out of clandestive funds, and its field of competence covered the security of the state and the preservation of morals. In 1537, the Ten established the Esecutori contra la Bestemmia to suppress vice.

<h3>Description</h3>
Michiel Sanmicheli, like Jacopo Sansovino was a salaried official of the Republic of Venice, but unlike Sansovino, his commissions lay in Venetian territories outside Venice, he was no less distinguished as a military architect, and was employed in 1535 in charge of all fortifications of the Republic, not just in the Venetian lagoon, but on the mainland and in Venice's possessions in the eastern Mediterranean, including Crete, Candia, Dalmatia, Istria and Corfu. His largest project for Venice was Fortezza di Sant'Andrea (1545), defending the Lido entrance to the Venetian lagoon. In visiting Cyprus and Crete for the Serenissima Sanmicheli is probably the only practicing Italian architect of the sixteenth century to have had the opportunity to see Greek architecture, a possible source for his use of Roman Doric columns without bases. It was in the military field that Sanmicheli's career was first influenced by the Cornaro family. Girolamo Cornaro, then newly installed as Capitano (military commander) at Padua, encountered Sanmicheli in 1538 as architect for the famous fortification there that became known as Bastion Cornaro. In the following year he also commissioned Sanmicheli to design a new palace, Villa Cornaro. Later, Girolamo's brother Giovanni Cornaro commissioned Sanmicheli to design a new atrium for Ca' Lando-Cornaro (later known as Ca' Cornaro-Spinelli) on the Grand Canal in Venice. The Sanmicheli designed Ca' Cornaro was constructed in 1555. The second great Venetian palazzo designed by Sanmicheli was Ca' Grimani, constructed on the Grand Canal in the late 1550s for the late Doge Grimani family. Sanmicheli outlined his ideas on classical architecture in a book titled, The Five Orders of Architecture. He closed his career with the design of the circular Church of the Madonna di Campagna near Verona, 1559.

<h3>Description</h3>
The loss of Cyprus in 1571, triggered the formation of a Holy League, mainly formed by Spain, Venice and Papal States, with the combined fleet under command of Don Juan de Austria. The interests of Venice and Spain were very different: Venice wanted to recover Cyprus, and Spain wanted to recover her North African presidios, and they could only agree in fighting the Ottoman navy. The ensuing battle at Lepanto was the biggest naval battle in modern times with over 32,000 casualties (by comparison Trafalgar had only 3,000), 25,000 of them in the Ottoman side. The Ottoman fleet was almost completely destroyed. News of the victory were extremely well received by the Christians that suffered the Ottoman and Barbary piracy. Although the Ottomans rebuilt their fleet and recaptured Tunis a second time in 1574, their naval supremacy in the Mediterranean was destroyed forever.

<h3>Description</h3>
This office was founded in 1556, and was established for the improvement of agriculture by increasing acreage under cultivation and encouraging private investment in agricultural improvement. The consistent rise in the price of grain during the 16th century encouraged the transfer of capital from trade to the land.

<h3>Description</h3>
During the war between the Ottoman Empire and Venice, the famous corsair Khair-ad-din Barbarossa ravaged the small Aegean islands that were the possession of some Venetian families. In the island of Paros he captured a 13 years old girl. She was Cecilia Veniero, niece of the great admiral and Doge Sebastian Veniero. Barbarossa presented her to Suleyman's harem, where she was given the name of Nurbanu, custodian of the light. A few years later she became the kadin or favourite of Selim the Sot, and after he died she became the Valide Sultan, or mother of the reigning Sultan, Murad III. The Valide Sultan was the third most influential position in the Ottoman Empire, after the Sultan and the Grand Vizier, and during the 130 years of the Kadinlar Sultanati, or Reign of Women, they often controlled the Sultan. Nurbanu was a pro-Venetian influence.

<h3>Description</h3>
The gondola was among the most enduring of numerous flat-bottomed craft that were developed to navigate the lagoon's shallow waters. The first written reference to a gondola dates to the XIth century, and at the height of their popularity in the XVIIth century, more than 5,000 gondolas were active on Venice's waterways. They were made slim to maneuver the narrowest canals and topped with 'felzi', small cabins that allowed to travel incognito. Originally the color of gondolas wasn't regulated, though they were predominantly black from the pitch used to keep them water tight. When in the XVIth century private boats started to become exceptionally lavish and larger as much as to block circulation, sumptuary laws were enacted mandating that they be the uniform black and sized 11m x 1,75m x 70 Kgs.

<h3>Description</h3>
When in 1570 the Turks sent an ultimatum to Venice asking for the ceding of Cyprus and then invaded the island after the Republic of San Marco failed to respond, a great uproar was created in the Catholic world by the facts and rumors of Ottoman atrocities in the last Christian bastion of the eastern Mediterranean. After a first failure in the summer of 1570, Pope Pius V managed to convince major Catholic nations (except France) to join a Holy League against the heathens Turks, and it was proclaimed in May 1571. The League would lead to the great naval victory of Don Juan on the Turks at Lepanto, but would not outlast this first and final triumph. Selim II is rumored to have said, after the news he had lost 200 galleys at Lepanto: At Lepanto, the Christians have shaved me. At Cyprus, I cut their arm. My beard will grow again.

<h3>Description</h3>
Tintoretto, who's real name was Jacopo Comin was one of the greatest painters of the Venetian school and probably the last great painter of the Italian Renaissance. In his youth he went by the nickname Jacopo Robusti, as his father had defended the gates of Padua in a rather robust way against the imperial troops in 1509. For his phenomenal energy in painting he was termed Il Furioso, the furious, and his dramatic use of perspectival space and special lighting effects make him a precursor of baroque art.

Bianca Capello, at the age of 15, eloped to Florence with a poor bank clerk. However, she quickly got tired of him and his overbearing mother, and managed to catch the eye of Francesco de Medici, the reprobate son of Cosimo de Midici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Unfortunately, Francesco was married to the morosely pious Archduchess Joanna of Austria. The Old Duke died, and the bank clerk was killed in a street brawl. The new Duke installed Bianca in his palace as his mistress. Joanna died in childbirth, and in less than two months Francesco and Bianca were married. Francesco sent an ambassador to Venice requesting that the Republic should signify her pleasure and gratification by declaring his wife a Daughter ofthe Republic, a high honor.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1219, Venice had its first guild (Giustizia Vecia), the guild of tailors, this was followed by 52 more guilds in the next decade. The guilds where run by non-noble families responsible for issuing works in a chosen profession in the Veneto. By 1582, there where 163 Guild masters in the Veneto and Venice. In that same year, the Venetian senate being short of manpower for its galley fleet proposed a contract to the guild masters to supply men as per request by the state for a reduction of 30 percent income tax. The only other clause was that for every 7 men the guild hired to work at their profession, 1 worker had to be over 55 years of age and not used for the fleet. The religious interference component that all guilds of Europe seemed to be effected with was, restricted to the catholic church of San Biasio, which had the support of the Venetian nobles. This contract lasted till 1773.

Sofia Baffo was a beautiful Venetian girl, that was captured by Turkish corsairs while she was going to visit her father, governor of Corfu. She was sold in the slave market to the Sultan's harem, where she was given the name of Safiye, the pure. She was taken under the protection of her compatriot Nurbanu and became the favourite of her son Murad III. She managed to keep her influence by constantly introducing to him new concubines to feed his insatiable apetite for women. After the death of Murad and the ascension of her son Mehmet III, she achieved the maximum status of Valide Sultan or mother of the Sultan. She corresponded with other sovereigns of her time, like Queen Elizabeth of England, and maintained the pro-Venetian policy of Nubaru.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1583 the Pope under pressure from Spain announced a ban on Italian manpower supply to all states except Spain. Venice, shocked by this decision as well as its dwindling supply of christian Albanian militia, which lasted four generations, decided to draw its new manpower from Lorraine, Provence, Corsica, Bavaria and the Grisons, this new supply line would last another 100 years. In 1585, Nicolo Contradini, repeating his usual complaints about foreign garrison troops in the Veneto, initiated the first annual teraferma garrison rotation system involving the use of Veneti militia instead of colonial militia.

<h3>Description</h3>
Until the XIIIth century Venice was built on a group of islands separated by channels. Access across the bodies of water was enabled through the installation of wooden planks. As time passed, many bridges were constructed in Venice, but none connecting the banks of the Grand Canal. This was a rather big problem for the city, and the population would always tease the High Council about it. To prevent the humiliation, a wooden bridge across the Grand Canal was set up in Rialto, in the heart of Venice, named La Pуnt. However, upkeep costs were high due to frequent restorations of the partially submerged, rapidly rotting, and in 1524 collapsed La Pуnt. To solve this problem the High Council decided to call in some of the best architects in all of Italy: Andrea Palladio and Vincenzo Scamozzi. Both architects presented drawings of a bridge featuring three great arches, all ending in the centre of the bridge, where a kettledrum sustained by huge columns was to be installed. In spite of the great fame of both architects and the magnificence of their plans a project by Antonio da Ponte would win. His suggestion was a unique arch bridge, 48 meters long, 22 meters wide, and high enough to allow boats to pass under, and it was immediately chosen, discarding Palladio's majestic project. Construction was started in 1588, and it took some years to finally join the opposite parts of the Grand Canal, finally replacing La Pуnt, who would only live on in Vittore Carpaccio's famous painting 'The Healing of the Obsessed'.

Two clerics, Scipio Saraceni and Marcantonio Brandolin were denounced and accused of rape, and murder. The Ten verified the justice of the charges and arrogated to itself the responsibility of trial and punishment. Pope Paul V demanded that the two be handed over to ecclesiastical courts. This matter brought to a head conflict that was already brewing with the church over the right to appoint a Patriach, taxes, and church properties in Venice. The Pope pronounced a sentence of excommunication, and laid an interdict on Venice. Venice turned to Paolo Sarpi, a theologian, expert in canon law, dialectician, scientist, and political philosopher to argue their case. Also, King Henry IV was asked to mediate with the Pope. The Papacy tried to save face, but it was clear that the interdict had failed. Never again would the Pope attempt to interdict a nation, and papal authority over Catholic Europe suffered a blow from which it could never quite recover.

<h3>Description</h3>
Galileo was born in Pisa in Tuscany. He is chiefly remembered for his work on free fall, his use of the telescope and his employment of experimentation. In 1592 Galileo was appointed professor of mathematics at the university of Padua (the university of the Republic of Venice). There his duties were to teach Euclid's geometry and astronomy. In the summer of 1609 Galileo made a series of telescopes. The astronomical discoveries he made with his telescopes were described in a book called 'Messenger from the stars' (Sidereus Nuncius) published in Venice in May 1610. Galileo claimed to have seen mountains on the Moon, to have proved the Milky Way was made up of tiny stars, and to have seen four small bodies orbiting Jupiter. These last, with an eye on getting a job in Florence, he promptly named 'the Medicean stars'.

<h3>Description</h3>
The cremonese Claudio Monteverdi went to Mantua in 1591 to serve as a string player at the court of Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga. Monteverdi then became known as a leading exponent of the modem approach to harmony and text expression. In 1607 his first opera, 'Orfeo', was produced in Mantua, and is considered the first opera. In 1613 Monteverdi was appointed 'maestro di cappella' at St. Mark's, Venice. Monteverdi can be justly considered one of the most powerful figures in the history of music.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Uskoks were refugees from the fighting in the Balkans who settled in the town of Senj near Istria. From this port, they raided Muslim, and frequently Venetian shipping. The expense of protecting shipping became increasingly prohibitive for the Venetians, and in 1613 they raided Senj. The Habsburgs responded by raiding Venetian territory. The Serenissima had to decide whether to escalate the crisis, or to step down and continue to provide escorts to the trade.

</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
During 1615, Doge Giovanni Bembo, hero of Lepanto, initiated an agressive policy against the Austrian Habsburgs in the war of Gradisca (Uskok war), and supported Savoy in her fights with the Spanish Habsburgs in Milan. The Spanish reprisal was the authorization to the Duke of Osuna, Viceroy of Naples, to attack Venice in the Adriatic with his private fleet under his own banner during the 1617 season. Venice protested these attacks, but the King of Spain privately supported Osuna despite his public repudiation. In November 1617 the peace between Austria and Venice was signed in Madrid, and although Gradisca remained in Austrian hands, the Uskok problem was solved. Then, right after the deaths of Doge Bembo and his successor in two months, in May 1618 the Council of Ten ordered the execution of 300 French and Spaniards working for Venice at the Arsenal. Venice was shaken by the bloodiest incident in her history, and a rumor started that a great danger had been avoided. Although no solid evidence was provided, the Signoria claimed that Osuna had tried to take over the city from the inside, but that the plot had been uncovered by one of the implicated. Amidst public outcry, the Spanish ambassador, the Marquis of Bedmar, had to leave Venice, while one of Osuna's agents, the immortal writer Francisco de Quevedo, narrowly escaped death. Some Venetian nobles were exiled. Wether the conspiracy was such, or some covert operation aborted is still debated. Osuna fell out of favour a couple of years later, and was recalled to Spain to die in 1624 in confinment without judgement, while Venice initiated a more peaceful period.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1627, Renier Zen, a Capi of the Council of Ten, emerged as a vocal critic of the Doge, Cornaro, accusing him of running Venice for his own family's benefit by, among other things, turning a blind eye to his son Giorgio's trafficking in contraband goods. On October 27, Zen caused an uproar at a meeting of the Great Council by accusing the Cornaro family of corruption, although the elections were annulled, he was unable to obtain any further sanctions. On December 30, Renier Zen was attacked by masked assassins, who were later found to include Giorgio Cornaro, the son of the Doge. Zen grew even more outspoken in his criticism of Cornaro in the wake of Giorgio Cornaro's failed assassination attempt. Venice now became divided into two factions, a pro-Conaro faction that was pro-papal and backed by the Venetian oligarchs, and a pro-Zen faction that was anti-papal and backed by the poorer nobility. Rioting broke out between the two factions on July 23, 1628, and for the rest of Cornaro's life, Venice was locked in a civil war. The Venetian government had basically broken down by late 1628.

<h3>Description</h3>
Galileo continued his work on motion and on mechanics, and began to get involved in disputes about Copernicanism. Galileo showed a marked tendency to use all his discoveries as evidence for Copernicanism, and to do so with great verbal as well as mathematical skill. Copernicanism was in contradiction with Scripture, and in 1616 Galileo was given some kind of secret, but official, warning that he was not to defend Copernicanism. Just what was said on this occasion was to become a subject for dispute when Galileo was accused of departing from this undertaking in his 'Dialogue concerning the two greatest world systems', published in 1632.

<h3>Description</h3>
Over the centuries the Venetian state made numerous attempts to limit gambling which was encouraged in the 'casini', real status symbols for the Venetian noblemen of those times, consisting in small apartments, or even just single rooms with extremely elegant furniture and laden with gilt and stuccoes, where a certain crowd would gather, especially at night, for the most varied purposes such as prostitution, dancing, dining and music and naturally gambling. In the end the High Council realised that prohibition was not the best way to act and decided to at least reap some benefit from the situation: in 1638 the first public gambling house was thus opened. This was the 'Ridotto' in Palazzo Dandolo near San Moisи, just a few steps from St Marks Square and from the southern access to the Grand Canal. Thanks to this the Republic collected a huge flow of cash otherwise destined for private coffers.

The Treaty of the Pyrenees was a treaty signed in 1659 to end the war between France and Spain that had begun in 1635 during the Thirty Years' War. It was signed on Оle des France. On 7 November 1659, with this signing of the Treaty of the Pyrenees, Venice received more aid from the other western states, especially from France who arrived in Candia under the Papal Flag. This was done as to not destroy the good relations between France and the Ottomans.

<h3>Description</h3>
The backbone of the Venetian fleet had always been its galleys and galleasses. Naval battles were decided by boarding, as had been the case at Lepanto. But naval tactics had been revolutionized by the galleon, with rows of cannon on its sides, and by the Line-of-battle fleet, which derived from it. Venice chartered some Dutch and British ships, and adopted merchant ships for military purposes. After this the first line ship was built in the Arsenal in 1667, to the design of a British ship. In the next 50 years 68 of these ships came from the Arsenal's shipyards.

<h3>Description</h3>
In the late XVIIth century, the disuse of the Mediterranean sea as the main international trade junction between Europa and the East Indies brought the Italian economic system to collapse. Italy became more removed from the mainstream of European development and each local administration along the peninsula lagged behind that of any other European contemporary. The practice of agriculture as prevailing economic activity meant the coming back to power of the most conservative landowning aristocracy. That economic backwardness associated with the effects of Counterreform deeply affected Italian social life too, now less and less inclined to accept innovation and to develop some entrepreneurial attitude.

She also studied mathematics, philosophy and theology and was also a proficient musician of several instruments and composer. She was famous throughout Europe. After studying at the university of Padua, she was not given the doctorate in theology for being a woman, but was finally awarded a degree in philosophy on the 25 of June 1678, becoming the first woman to earn a degree in the whole world, and for 75 more years the only one. She was member of various european academies and very esteemed not only for her learning, but for her virtuous and charity. Her passing at the age of 38 caused great mourning in Padua and Venice.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Treaty of Karlowitz was signed on January 26, 1699, concluding the Austro-Ottoman War of 1683–1697 in which the Ottoman side had finally been defeated at the Battle of Senta. Following a two-month congress between the Ottoman Empire on one side and the Holy League of 1684, a coalition of various European powers including the Habsburg Monarchy, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Republic of Venice and Muscovite Russia, a treaty was signed on January 26, 1699. The Ottomans ceded most of Hungary, Transylvania and Slavonia to Austria while Podolia returned to Poland. Most of Dalmatia passed to Venice, along with the Morea (the Peloponnesus peninsula). The Treaty of Karlowitz marked the beginning of the Ottoman decline in Eastern Europe, and made the Habsburg Monarchy the dominant power in Central Europe.

<h3>Description</h3>
Noble Venetian women from the 14th Century where ordered to wear only black dresses with Silver of Gold trim to distinguish themselves from the populace. Women rarely ever heeded this law and went about purchasing local dresses from the silk makers of the Veneto or importing them from France or other parts of Italy. In 1703, the senate changed the law and forbid the use of black dresses to be worn by any women except for attending funerals of the family and also restricted the use of the black dress to last only one week.

<h3>Description</h3>
By 1718 having lost the Morea for the second time as well as Crete 50 years earlier, the Venetians had no more Greek militia to use except for the Greeks of Corfu and the Ionian islands. These Greeks where barely enough to defend their islands and where always propped up by the Venetian military. Venice now only had its Dalmatian militia as well as the expensive hire of German or Dutch mercenaries left.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Venetian composer and violinist Antonio Vivaldi was born in Venice in 1678 and after his ordination in 1703 embarked on an intermittent career in the service of the Ospedal della Pietа, an institution for the education of orphan, illegitimate or indigent girls, an establishment with a formidable musical reputation. His later career brought involvement in opera. As a composer Vivaldi was prolific, with some 500 concertos to his credit, in addition to a quantity of works for the church and for the theatre. He left Venice in 1741 in the apparent hope of finding new patrons in Vienna, where he died shortly after his arrival in the city.

<h3>Description</h3>
The littorals of the Venetian lagoons were continuously involved by destructive phenomena such as marine and eolian erosion. In 1738 the Republic of Venice realised along the littorals of Malamocco, Pellestrina and Sottomarina the so-called 'Murazzi': sea defensive works made up of Istrian stone and 'pozzolana'. They were jetties whose aim was to create a barrier to prevent the sea from attacking and eroding the banks. The idea of building these defensive works was conceived in 1716 by Father Vincenzo Coronelli. He sent the 'Savii d'acue' ('Savi alle Acque' in Italian), main office in charge of civilian public works, his innovative project, in which he proposed to substitute the traditional sea defensive works made up of oak trunks and filling material with a real staircase made up of Istrian stone blocks. But it was the Water, Rivers, and Lagoon supervisor Bernardino Zendrini who carried out this project thanks to the employ of 'pozzolana', a recently discovered material which solidifies when it is mixed to lime and if it comes in touch with water. This way the Istrian stone blocks welded with each other and made the 'Murazzi' barrier even more effective.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1646 and 1684, 70 and 48 new families respectively paid to be registered in the Golden book of Venetian nobles and obtain a vote in the council. Of these new families many by 1700 had fallen to desperate financial problems. This condition of fallen nobility was termed Barnabotti due to these nobles meeting in the area of Campo San Barnaba. Barnabotti who, despite having lost many of their financial resources, continued to maintain the right to sit on the Greater Council, continued to vote in the assembly and decided the fate of the city and the state. Clothing and food for the Barnabotti was provided by the state. The barnabotti had frequent conflicts with the remaining body of the wealthy nobility, but at the same time, because of their lack of economic means, sold their votes and this caused certain unwanted nobles to achieve certain positions of power. In 1740, Doge Alvise Pisani tried to amend the voting regulations of the Nobles, remove the votes of the barnabotti and amend the constitution but was outvoted by the Venetian council.

<h3>Description</h3>
In XVIIIthe century the 'Ridotto' was one of the city's main attractions and had enormous international renown, alongside that of the Venetian carnival. People visiting the Ridotto were generally curious visitors, nobles and courtesans, pimps and prostitutes, usurers and police informants, but in most case just degenerate gamblers of every social background. Except for the croupiers and the Barnabots, impoverished Venetian noblemen, all visitors were obliged to wear three-cornered hats, capes and masks in order to access incognito the gambling places. The Ridotto was open to the public only during carnival, which could often last six months in Venice, from October to February-March. In 1774, because of many concerns about frequent nobles' gambling problems the High Council voted on a motion aiming at 'the preservation of piety, sound discipline and moderate behaviour' and the Ridotto was definitively closed. The city stood terribly shocked with great damage to the profits of pimps, usurers, hosts, shop-keepers, mask-makers and Barnabot noblemen. It seemed that no state can keep going without the aid of vice...

<h3>Description</h3>
When Angelo Emo first took to the sea he immediately made his mark and, in 1766, when hostilities broke out once more between Algiers and Venice, it was Emo who, in two years of continuous warfare, succeeded in restoring the supremacy of the Venetian navy in African waters in order to protect the commercial interests of the Republic. But Emo realising that decay had set in with Venetian shipping since 1720, convened a conference in 1775 in upgrading the naval arm similar to that of England's. During the next decade, Angelo Emo reorganised the extensive dockyard of the Republic, he occupied the highest posts in the Magistracy and redirected money that was to be used for defensive maintenance. Soon after, he was once more engaged to suppress the rising power of the Barbary corsairs. Eventually, the Venetian Republic declared war on the Bey of Tunis and, on 27 June 1784, the newly built fleet sailed down the Adriatic under the supreme command of Emo. Between October 1784 and October 1786 the Venetian fleet bombarded and razed to the ground Tunis and La Goletta, Susa, Sfax and Bizerta. Highly effective during this operation were the floating batteries which could move close to the target, and which were of Emo's own invention. As a result of this campaign, the freedom of trade in the Mediterranean was assured, and by his military successes the Venetian admiral consolidated his honoured place in the annals of the Republic that gave him birth.

<h3>Description</h3>
Venice power steadily declined during the last decade while the Ottoman Empire and Austria where also steadily expanding theirs. Seven Wars against the Ottoman Empire had depleted the republic's resources. The final death blow was dealt to Venice by an unexpected side: France, a republic like Venice itself ignored the wish of Venice to stay neutral in the conflict between France and Austria. Soon french troops invaded northern italy and successfully forced the austrian forces out of Milan - and chased them even across venetian territorry - and discovering that Venice lacked the power to deny them anything the french general Napoleon Bonaparte despite his own italian origins as Napoleone Buonaparte decided to take what noone could deny him. Is this the end of the Serenissima?

<h3>Description</h3>
Rossini studied in Bologna and began his operatic career when, at 18, he wrote a one-act comedy for Venice. Further commissions followed, from Bologna, Ferrara, Venice again and Milan. His first operas to win international acclaim come from 1813, written for different Venetian theatres: the serious 'Tancredi' and the comic 'L'italiana in Algieri', the one showing a fusion of lyrical expression and dramatic needs, with its crystalline melodies, arresting harmonic inflections and colourful orchestral writing, the other moving easily between the sentimental, the patriotic, the absurd and the sheer lunatic. In 1815 Rossini went to Naples as musical and artistic director of the Teatro San Carlo, which led to a concentration on serious opera.

<h3>Description</h3>
For more then ten years Northern Italy was the war theater of 'Mercenari' at disposal of the best offerer between Milan and the other Italian states united in a League originally formed by Venice and Florence. It was to the interest of all soldiers of fortune of both sides to make the operations last as long as possible, to avoid decisive operations and to liberate all prisoners quickly. Consequently the campaign were very exhausting and dragged on interminably, some battles were won and others lost, truces and peace treaties were made only to be broken, and no definite result was achieved. A peace treaty was also stipulated in Ferrara in 1428 in which at first Visconti stated to renounce claims to territories lying beyond the Panaro-Magra Rivers, but refused to concede the territories of Bergamo and Brescia to Venice, which was still occupying with her troops. Political and economic interests of both sides were conflicting and when the new Pope, Eugenius IV, was being suspected of involvement with the League to damage Milan, Visconti retaliated sending his troops to invade the Papal States. That represented a violation of the peace treaty and subsequently a new Antivisconti League was formed to wage war against Milan.

<h3>Description</h3>
Carmagnola escaped from Milan and arrived in Venice to offer his services there. At first, he wasn't well received in Venice, for he was the most famous of Milanese condottieri and a real threat to the Republic. But as soon as the Venetians knew that Visconti imprisoned his family and confiscated all of his estates and that conspirators at the service of Visconti attempted to poison him, Carmagnola was appointed captain-general of St Mark in 1426 and the Antivisconti league-confederates declared war on Milan. Carmagnola's most important success was the battle of Maclodio (1427), but he did not follow it up. The Republic, impatient of his dilatoriness, raised his emoluments and promised him immense fiefs including the lordship of Milan, so as to increase his ardour, but in vain. At the same time Carmagnola was perpetually receiving messengers from Visconti, who offered him great rewards if he would abandon the Venetians.The general trifled with his past as with his present employers, believing in his foolish vanity that he held the fate of both in his hand. But the Venetians were dangerous masters to trifle with and their patience was soon to be lost...

<h3>Description</h3>
The war for Candia lasted 24 years, from 1645 to 1669, and was markedly different from the 1570-73 war against the Turks. The latter was an epoch-making conflict of empires and civilisations at the height of their powers - in political and military terms Venice was actually the greatest Christian power active in the Levant. After 1640, when it became clear that the Turks had set their sights on Candia, Venice mobilised a formidable fleet, which included ships of galleys, galleasses and galleons for a fleet total of 120. In the course of 24 years of war the Venetians were generally on the offensive, often achieving stunning victories, including preventing the ability of the Turks to organise convoys of reinforcements for Crete. On prior commencement to the conflict, Venice sent 33000 troops to Crete of which 12000 where mercenaries from Hanover, Brunswick and Cleves, a further 5000 Venetian troops where sent to Dalmatia.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1575, during the epidemic of plague that ravaged the city, Veronica Franco was forced to leave Venice and lost much of her wealth when her house and possessions were looted. On her return in 1577, she defended herself with dignity in an Inquisition for witchcraft and bringing the plague to Venice (a common complaint lodged against courtesans in those days). The charges were dropped. A well-educated woman, Veronica Franco wrote two volumes of poetry, Terze rime in 1575 and Lettere familiari a diversi in 1580.

<h3>Description</h3>
Vincenzo di Mantova's death initiated a struggle between his cousins' Carlo I di Nevers and Ferrante II di Guastalla. Guastalla marched on Mantova with the backing of his allies - Imperatore Ferdinando II, Filipo IV of Spain and Carlo Emmanule I di Savoja. As the conflict influenced the balance of power in Italy, the Serenмsima entered on Nevers side. However the Armies of San Marco were defeated trying to relieve the Siege of Mantova (1629), with the Republic having no say in the Peace of Susa (Apr 1630), Regensburg (Oct 1630) or Cherasco (1631). What it did get was the plague brought by the invading French and Germans - costing 50,000 Venetian lives.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1761, Anzolo Querini who was not a barnabotti had a meeting with Pierin Negrin who was the senator of Military affairs of the mainland, Savio di terraferma, to support the Barnabotti to try to amend the constitution, as they saw the reigning Doge and the council of Ten as corrupt and insensitive to the needs and changes that the Venetian Republic needed. To gain access to fight the Council of Ten, Anzolo Querini became the Chief State Prosecutor, Avogadore di Comun, with this power, Anzolo swayed the vote of the nobles to amend the constitution to share the wealth of all the nobles, remove the patriarchs of Aquileia which merged in 1751 with patriarchs of Venice and cut ties with the Pope, and also the reigning Doge was interned in the Castle of San Felice in Verona. All Nobles not supporting the change left for foreign lands.

In 1421 the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed I, died. His son, Murad II, ascended the throne. However, the Byzantines were holding Mehmed's brother, Mustafa, prisoner on the island of Lemnos. Hoping for the best, and urged on by his son (John VIII), Manuel II released this pretender to the throne, creating civil war in the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians took the opportunity to attack the Ottoman navy.

<h3>Description</h3>
Fought against the expansionist policies of the Papacy, it began with the Papal seizure of Ferrara when the legitimate d'Este line ended in 1598. They also absorbed Urbino when its ruling family, the della Rovere died out in 1631. Moreover the Pope insisted on papal primacy, making every bishop in northern Italy a petty tyrant and straining relations with the local ruling princes. When Pope Urban VIII banned Parmesan grain imports then occupied Farnese Castro for failing to repay Roman creditors, Duke Odoardo Farnese responded with his own military expedition with his allies Modena, Tuscany and Venice (who all lost lands to the Pope). After a crushing the Papal Army at Lagoscuro in 1644 the ban was lifted and Farnese compelled to continue repaying his debt. The conflict was renewed in 1649 by Odoardo's successor Ranuccio II who discontinued the payments rendered by his father to the Roman creditors. In response Pope Innocent X reoccupied Castro and razed the city, compelling Farnese to cede Castro and its nearby territories to the Papacy.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1459 Pope Pius II called the Congress of Mantua to organise a crusade against the Turk, but only a few delegates showed up. By 1461 the crusade had made no progress so Pius asked Mehmed II to convert. Since that didn't work either, he decided to lead the crusade himself despite being ill. France was at odds with the Pope, Burgundy delayed their help, Milan was trying to seize Genoa, and Florence cynically advised the Pope to let the Turks and the Venetians wear each other out. But the Venetians and the Hungarians signed their support in 1463. Thousands of destitute men from all of Europe came to the Pope's call and he led them to Ancona in the summer of 1464, where he became very ill. While waiting for the Venetian fleet, plague broke out and the crusade army melted away. On August 14, when the Venetians finally arrived, the Pope expired. Doge Christoforo Moro seeing no army and no fleet but his 12 galleys, took the 40,000 ducats collected to pay the Hungarians from the cardinals and returned home.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Spanish hegemony in the Italian peninsula was exercised by means of heavy bureaucracy and harsh taxation directly in the Habsburg dominions of Milan and Naples and indirectly in the rest of the peninsula by forcing the other minor Italian states to respect Spanish economic and diplomatic directives. The vassalage to Spain, which granted to some extent an enduring peace in Italy afer the Italian Wars, which the historians would call 'the pax hispanica', together with the disuse of the Mediterranean sea as international trade route towards the East Indies brought the Italian economic system to eventually collapse. As a result of this agriculture will become the prevailing economic activity in Italy until the end of XIXth century. That meant the coming back to power of the landowning aristocracy.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1510 Venice submitted to the Pope, thus lessening the league of Cambrai. Conditions were hard for Venice, the Republic had to renounce her traditional power to appoint bishops as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venetian territory and was to compensate Pope Julius II for his war expenses needed to recapture the Papal holdings in Romagna, while the Pope accepted the humble request of the Republic for pardon, cancelling the interdict. But the reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French to continue the war against Venice with attacks to her cities in Terraferma. Julius II, in the meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy and formulated plans, both to chase the French out of the Po Valley and to seize the Duchy of Ferrara, a French ally, with the intention to add the territories of Modena, Reggio and Ferrara to the Papal States. In realizing his plan the Pope immediately excommunicated Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, declaring his fief forfeited for his remaining loyal to France, then he gained the military support of Venice, eager to recover her territories lost to the French a armies and hired an army of Swiss mercenaries to attack Milan as to isolate the French armies in Italy. However his plans failed as the French army managed to invade Romagna and occupy the cities of Bologna and Ravenna, supported by the powerful and celebrated artillery of Duke Alfonso d'Este. In addition, in response to Pope's switching sides, Louis XII of France convoked a Schismatic Council at Pisa as to have the 'Warrior Pope' deposed. Pope Julius II, having unsuccessfully pressed the Republic of Florence to refuse hosting the schismatic cardinals, proclaimed the Holy League against France and convoked a Council of his own to meet at the Lateran in Rome. The promise of territorial gains at French expense caused Ferdinand II of Aragon and Emperor Maximilian I to abandon their alliance with the French, and in October 1511, they joined the newly-formed Holy League together with Julius II and the Republic of Venice. In November, Henry VIII of England and the Swiss confederation joined as well.

<h3>Description</h3>
The fall of Alexandria and the Levant trade into Ottoman hands was a disaster for Venice. The spice trade decayed even further, and the sale of Central European silver to the Mamluks stopped, leading to an overabundance of the precious metal that caused inflation. Worse than that, Venetian trade was now in the hands of the Ottomans, that periodically attacked Venice depriving her from her most precious possessions. In the war of 1463-1479 Venice lost Scodra, Kroja, Negroponte and Lemnos. In the war of 1499-1503 Venice lost Modon, Coron, Lepanto, Navarino, and Durazzo. The fall of Egypt has brought a new source of conflict. When the Venetians managed to get control of Cyprus, they offered to continue paying a tribute to the Mamluk Bey, theoretical suzerain of the island, to maintain privileged commercial relations with Egypt. It was a mistake, as now the Sultan of the Ottomans claims lordship over Cyprus and requests that the tribute is paid to him in gold instead of cloths as we used to do. Venice accepted to pay, but dispatched Giovanni Sammichele and Giulio Savorgnan, his best military engineers, to strengthen the fortifications at Cyprus, knowing that the Turks would eventually attack the island.

<h3>Description</h3>
On 7 April 1498, upon Charles VIII's death at Amboise (he knocked his head while passing through a doorway in his going to see a game of real tennis), the throne passed to his cousin Louis of Orlйans, who reigned as Louis XII of France. On his accession, he took the titles of Duke of Milan and King of Sicily, sending a shrounding chill through Italy, especially to Ludovico Sforza, who had seized Milan from his nephew Gian Galeazzo, and that upon his death, had seen his claim legitimized by Maximilian King of the Romans. Louis XII came to throne in France with the clear idea of avenging his previous defeat by Ludovico and make good his claim to Milan from his Visconti grandmother. Milan and her dependency, Genoa, were seen as the key to Italy. So Louis XII, preparing to make good his claim on Milan, wanted to enlist the help of the main Italian powers, to avoid the mistakes of his cousin Charles VIII. In the meanwhile the anti-Venetian sentiment had been running high, attempts were made by Italian ambassadors to poison the relationships between Venice and the Ottoman Empire and try to induce the latter to declare war to the former. It was clear that Venice could very well side with the French and that occurred with the stipulation of the treaty of Blois, where Venice would recognize French claims to Milan and in exchange for military support and money would receive the Milanese territories east of the Adda river. Louis then stipulated a peace treaty with Ferdinand of Spain and enforced the truce with Maximilian of Habsburg. He made also a pact with Pope Alexander VI: in exchange for a papal bull to annul his marriage to the crippled sister of late Charles VIII and marry Charles' widow, Anne of Brittany, the Pope's son, Cesare Borgia, received the duchy of Valentinois with the hand of Charlotte d'Albret, sister to the King of Navarre and a promise of French military support to form his own duchy in Romagna. After having secured his friendship with Philibert II of Savoy Louis XII crossed the Alps and assembled his powerful army in Asti, a small county in Piedmont that belonged to the House of Orlйans as marriage dowry of Valentina Visconti, his grandmother. In the summer of 1499, the French army led by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, a Milanese noble, invaded the duchy of Milan from West, in the meanwhile, a Venetian army attacked from East. Town after town surrendered and the Milanese armies disappeared. As soon as a revolt broke out in Milan, Ludovico left the city together with his family and his treasure. By September 1499 the French troops made their entrance in Milan warmly welcome by the population.

<h3>Description</h3>
Murad rapidly put down Mustafa's revolt, and angrily attacked Byzantium. Manuel released another pretender, also named Mustafa, who was the brother of Murad, but this one fared no better. In 1423 the Turks invaded Morea, smashing through the Hexamilium (6 mile wall) that Manuel II had built across the Isthmus of Corinth for protection in 1414. They also pressed Thessalonica, still a Byzantine city, so hard that the governor turned it over to the Venetians and wished them better luck. By 1424, with no help forthcoming, the Byzantines sadly accepted vassalage to the Turks. Venice held onto Thessalonica until 1430.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Venetian occupation since 1204 of Candia was confronted with the rebellion of the Cretans, especially in the inland areas. The island was invaluable to the Republic for its products and commerce, but the inhabitants did not easily tolerate the new dominion. The Venetians were obliged to repress many revolts, and to do so more easily sent several Colonies of Nobles and Veneti citizens, to whom land was granted on condition of defending it for the Republic. In 1529 Khair ad din conquered Algiers and from there his corsairs sacked many Mediterranean towns, including Rettimo in Crete. In 1571 Cyprus fell to the Turks. These events had an influence also on the relations between the Cretans and the Venetians, the Turkish threat reduced the hostility towards the Venetian rule. In the XVIIth century the population of Crete was divided into four tiers, the Venetian noble families, the Cretan noble families, the citizens of the three main towns of Candia, La Canea and Rettimo and the rest of the population.

Venetians captured in war where always being ransomed by the families via the government representative, the Bailo, in the state in question, this was on many occasions hard to achieve.

The Venetian government contributed financially to help release these citizens and then cure or leviate ills of the ransomed citizens when they where returned to the Republic.
