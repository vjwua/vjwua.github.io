<h3>Description</h3>
Most of Sardinia fell to Aragon after the Battle of Sanluri in 1409. For the last ten years, William of Narbonne ruled the remnants of the Judicate of Arborea, but could not keep it. On August 14, 1420, he sold the rights to Arborea to Aragon for 100,000 florins. Sardinia was finally united.

<h3>Description</h3>
From the middle of the 14th century on, the Kings, upon request from the mercantile institutions, adopted protectionist measures, the first of which was a limitation on foreign ships insurances in 1345. In 1422 the importation of foreign clothes was forbidden, in an attempt to keep the competiveness of local products.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Council held in Constance from 1414 to 1418 brought an end to the Great Schism, declared its superiority over the Papacy, deposed two of the claimants popes (Gregorius XII elected in Rome and supported by Bayern, Naples, Hungary and Venice and Benedictus XIII elected in Avignon and supported by France, Castile, Aragon and Scotland) and pressed to abdicate the third (Johannes XXIII elected in the council of Pisa) and eventually chose a new pontiff, Martinus V. In spite of what had been decreed by the council of Constance, Benedictus XIII, Pedro de Luna, although deposed, continued to proclaim himself as the only legitimate Pope elected in Avignon. He also declared that the election of a new Pope to end the Great Schism could have been made according to his personal decision only and that he certainly would have confirmed himself as the new pontiff. Abandoned by his main supporters, the Kings of Aragon, Castile and Scotland amongst them, and due to his obstinacy Benedictus XIII preferred to retire in the fortress of Peñiscola near Valencia where he died in 1423. Stirred up by Alfons V hostile to Martinus V in the succession of Naples, the cardinals still faithful to the last Antipope elected a new successor, Clemens VIII, but that new Pope had authority only in Aragon and in 1429 he decided to submit to the Roman pontiff. His submission definitely put an end to the Great Schism of the Western Church.

<h3>Description</h3>
Queen Giovanna of Naples is dead. Her last will was that the crown should be given to René of Anjou, brother of Louis III of Anjou, her adopted son who died just three months before she did. Pope Eugenius IV declared that as suzerain he had the right to invest the new King and as for now he would send a bishop as temporary regent. However the Neapolitan people, determined to respect the will of their former Queen, ignored the Papal resolution and sent a delegation to Provence to urge René of Anjou to claim the throne in Naples. Since René of Anjou had been taken captive in Burgundy by Duke Philip the Fair, his wife Isabelle of Lorraine accepted the crown in his place. From his base in Sicily, Alfons of Aragon, who was designated heir by Giovanna between 1420 and 1423, and had a claim to Naples as King of Sicily, gained the support of the Neapolitan nobility hostile to the Anjou dynasty, and started making preparations to invade the Kingdom before the French Angevins could arrive in Naples and take the crown.

<h3>Description</h3>
After his release from Milan, Alfons returned to Naples, where his brother Pedro had conquered Gaeta. Naples was defended by Isabelle of Lorraine with the support of Pope Eugenius IV. For three years Alfonso conducted as much a diplomatic war as a military one, gaining allies to his cause from the Neapolitan nobles. In 1438, René of Anjou paid a huge ransom to Burgundy for his release, and arrived in the Kingdom, but since he had exhausted his funds his allies abandoned him and he had to retreat to Naples. A long siege was then established, during which the Infante Don Pedro was killed by a chance shot to the great grief of his brother. The support of the Genoese fleet allowed René to sustain the besieged capital, but finally on June 1, 1442, 300 well-armed men entered the town through an open drain accesible during the dry season, revealed to Alfons' son Ferrante by some prisoners. After several hours of fighting, Naples was conquered and René escaped to Florence. After conquering the rest of the Kingdom, Alfons entered the capital in triumph on February 23, 1443.

<h3>Description</h3>
One of the ever-present realities during the reign of Alfons V was the confrontation between the King, supported by the popular factions, and the oligarchy. This resulted in tumultuous parlamentary sessions during his reign. The situation was especially critical in Barcelona, where the municipal power (the 'Consell de Cent' which had great influence throughout the Kingdom) was in the hands of the oligarchic faction, called 'La Biga', formed by the wealthy urban patricians. Its power was opposed by the popular faction, called 'La Busca', supported by the King and formed by middle-class merchants and artisans. In 1453, the lieutenant of the King, Galceran de Requesens, removed the municipal power from 'La Biga' and gave it to 'La Busca'. The political situation was stressed nearly to the point of no-return.

<h3>Description</h3>
During the war of succession in Milan, all the belligerent nations were brought to exhaustion of money and troops. Francesco Sforza, ruler of Milan and Venice, the chief state of the league confederates, who was more and more threatened by the advancing Ottomans in her eastern Mediterranean territories, convened a cease-fire while a bilateral treaty was hastily signed in Lodi on 7 April 1454. With that treaty Sforza was legitimated Duke of Milan. Without even being called for, Florence and the Pope had no choice then to endorse the treaty. The King of Naples, being a rightful claimant on the ducal throne reluctantly joined the alliance under the condition to keep Genoa out of it. Intended 'infra terminos italicos', that treaty showed the objective impossibility for all the Italian major powers (specifically Milan, Tuscany, Venice, Naples and Papal States) to prevail upon each other in the struggle for the hegemony in Italy and that the better solution was to come to terms with each other. That would have also avoided the practice of very expensive and pointless wars in the next future. Although the treaty actually played a minor part in Italian balance of powers and so won't be able to avoid future wars of aggression from inside as well from outside Italy, the post-Lodi era historically represented a period of relative peace in which the figurative arts definitively flourished in the whole Italian peninsula, as well as economy and trade and, last but not the least, the skills and tricks of the art of diplomacy.

<h3>Description</h3>
Following the defeat of their leader, the rebellious Corsican feudal lords fled in Sicily or Sardinia. The most important families, including the d'Istria, have sent an embassy to our court in Napoli in order to ask for our support in regaining their influence in western Corsica. We might use them to regain our own influence.

<h3>Description</h3>
With the new King Joan II, the confrontation between the King and the oligarchy went on, reaching new heights. Carles de Viana was the son of the King Joan II. By 1450 there had already been various problems between father and son, which led the King, in 1456, to dispossess his son of his inheritance. But Carles won some support in Sicily and among the members of the Parliament, and the King imprisoned him in Barcelona in 1460. The Corts held in Lleida in the same year, dominated by the oligarchy, who opposed the King and supported the prince Carles, entrusted the Generalitat (permanent delegation of the Corts) the raising of an army in order to eventually fight the King in case he didn't accept their reivindications.

<h3>Description</h3>
After the death of the prince Carles de Viana, who supported the Corts and the oligarchy, the post of 'lieutenant of the King' went to the King's wife, Juana Enríquez, a faithful supporter of the royalist cause. The relation with the Corts became more difficult than ever as the Queen worked hard to restablish royalist power. The Corts and the Generalitat, afraid of possible reprisals against them for the previous events, began a persecution of royalist supporters and raised an army, with which they besieged the city of Girona, where the Queen and her son were at that very moment. The war seemed inevitable.

<h3>Description</h3>
After the outbreak of the war the Generalitat looked for a King to whom offer the crown. They offered the Kingdom successively to Enrique IV of Castilla, to Pedro of Portugal and to Renat of Provence. Enrique IV hesitated but finally declined the offer. Pedro accepted and he was, in fact, proclaimed King for a brief period until he died in 1466. Finally, Renat of Provence accepted as well, but after some military successes against the King Joan II he also gave up. These 'Kings' offered some military help to the armies of the Generalitat, but nevertheless, the royalist forces were gaining the upper hand.

<h3>Description</h3>
Aragon was inmersed in a civil war after the death of the Prince of Viana. Juan felt also the pressure from Louis XI of France that after accepting the Rousillon as a guaranty for payment in exchange for his help, had changed sides and keeping the Rousillon was now supporting the rebellion in Barcelona with troops. Given his bad relationship with Enrique IV of Castile, who had tried to steal his throne, Juan needed to ensure the neutrality of Castile, or even enlist her help, and for that he was counting on his son Fernando. Fernando had already shown his quality as a military leader, obtaining his first victory when he was 13 years old, and now at 17 was helping his father to pacify the difficult Kingdom. Juan sent ambassador Pierres de Peralta to negotiate a marriage agreement between Fernando and Beatriz, daughter of Juan Pacheco, Marquis of Villena, the most powerful noble in Castile during the rule of weak Enrique. But with the death of his brother Alfonso, Isabel had come to the forefront of Castilian politics, and was already pretended by Louis XI for his brother, the Duke of Guyenne, and by Alfonso V of Portugal for himself. Peralta understood the importance of Isabel in troubled Castile, and presented a marriage proposal to Isabel instead. Juan was soon in favor of this new arrangement, and named Fernando King of Sicily to better compete with the King of Portugal. The marriage of Isabel and Fernando could unite the two strongest Kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula solving their problems. However, when Enrique found out about the offer he was displeased, as he favored a union with Portugal and considered Juan his enemy.

<h3>Description</h3>
Fernando, young and imbued in the knighthood spirit of his time, decided to rescue Isabel from Villena and King Enrique, after receiving her letter accepting his marriage proposal. But the mountain passes were controlled by nobles loyal to Enrique with orders to stop him. To avoid being recognized, he disguised himself as a servant to a group of merchants, going to the extreme of having to serve them dinner at the stops. Running a serious risk, he crossed hostile territory before meeting the count of Treviño with 300 lances to protect him. Finally he arrived to Valladolid to meet his bride. It was love at first sight. However a problem remained, as Isabel and Fernando were second cousins and required papal dispensation. But Paul II was in good terms with Enrique, and had already granted a papal dispensation for Isabel and Alfonso V of Portugal, also related, and refused to give a second dispensation for the same person. But nothing could stand in the way of love, and a papal dispensation was quickly forged and dated five years before, during the papacy of Pius II. A real dispensation will not be obtained until 1471 with Sixtus IV, and by then the couple already had a daughter.

<h3>Description</h3>
Juan II monarchy was very troublesome. His disputes with his own son Carlos, and the resistance of the catalan nobility to his authority, ended in a civil war with the uprising of Barcelona in 1462. But the catalan serfs or remensa revolted in favor of the King against the nobles, and he had also the support of Aragon, Valencia and Sicily. The war was very long, and with foreign participation, as the catalan nobility offered the County to whoever offered help, including Enrique of Castile, Pedro of Portugal and Renee of Anjou. Finally, a blind seventy years old Juan was able to win and enter Barcelona in 1472. He wisely showed clemency and pardoned all implicated. His troubles with Louis XI continued as he tried to recover the Rousillon, ceded to the French King as a guaranty and not returned. He also helped his son Fernando, when the civil war started in Castile with the crowning of Isabel and Fernando in 1475. With the decisive defeat of the Portuguese at Toro in 1476, the war was reduced to a series of campaigns against rebel nobles. In his last days before dying of old age, Juan could finally rest, as he had secured the Kingdom of Aragon for his son, and he had set in motion the union of Aragon and Castile to form a strong iberian Kingdom.

<h3>Description</h3>
For centuries the Christians in the Iberian Peninsula have dreamed of restoring the Visigothic Kingdom that was destroyed by the Muslim invasion. Many Kings have tried to achieve this union of Christians by force of arms, and have carried the title of Hispaniorum Imperator. Between them Sancho III of Navarre and Alfonso VII of Castile nearly achieved unity. But it was not by force that unity could be imposed, as a strong sense of freedom had been developed by the Iberians in their long struggle against Islam, manifested in an equally long struggle against their Christian neighbors. But the peaceful union under Isabel and Fernando will finally achieve what force could not. Under the fierce independence there was a common layer that Fernando and Isabel will identify and use to unite the new country. It was religion and the concept of blood purity. Now, with the country at peace it was a question of prioritizing the international policies of the new powerful entity. First Granada, Castile's biggest dream, as a crusade was useful to unite the peasants and nobles of the country under the same banner. It was a tremendous task, as the Moorish resistance had concentrated in Granada's roughest terrain and 400 years of defensive works had made it a bastion that will require ten years of continuous assaults. It was soon clear to Europeans that a new political entity had been born, and both Iberians and foreigners started referring to it not as Castile and Aragon, but as Spain.

<h3>Description</h3>
Ferran II was forced to abolish the 'Sentència Interlocutòria' (Interlocutory Sentence) of 1455, which had abolished some peasant servitudes, 'els mals usos', to gain the agreement of the Corts of Catalonia to a much needed subsidy, pacify restless nobles and clergy and to push through some governmental reforms.

<h3>Description</h3>
Ferran II let the local nobles and clergy attempt to put down the revolt and he successfully got both sides to agree to let him arbitrate between them. He abolished most of the 'els mals usos' in exchange for payments to the nobility and clergy for damages inflicted during the revolt. While the peasant still owed his feudal obligations to his lord he was no longer bound to the land.

<h3><span class="country" title="ARG">Aragon</span> &mdash; Not random</h3>
<p>Will happen on <span class="date">July 30, 1492</span>
</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
Medieval Spain was unique in Western Europe for the diversity of its population. In addition to a large segment of Muslims, Spain had the single largest Jewish community in the world, with three hundred thousand souls. In the 14th Century, however, anti-Jewish attitudes were on the rise throughout Europe. In 1290, England expelled its Jews and France followed in 1306. Spain began to experience an increasing anti-Jewish sentiment. It exploded in the summer of 1391 with angry anti-Jewish riots with hundreds of deaths. These riots led to major forced conversions of Jews to Christianity. Unlike the remaining Jews, the converts were welcomed into a full participation in Spanish society and they would soon become leaders in government, science, business and the Church. Over the years the Old Christians saw these converted families as opportunists who secretly maintained the faith of their forefathers. It was a strong mixture of racial prejudice and jealousy against the converts that would stir-up the Spanish Inquisition to prosecute the minority of false-converts. On March 31, 1492, Isabel and Fernando signed the edict of expulsion of all Jews in their Kingdoms by July 31. They were allowed to sell their properties and take their valuables, and money in letters of payment, but no gold or silver. The Kings intended to force the conversion of most of them, and indeed many converted, raising the proportion of Jews converted along the century to two thirds of their original population. But many also chose to leave, their numbers still debated, but probably over 100,000, most of them from Castilla, Toledo, Andalucia, and Murcia. It was a popular measure probably intended to forge a national identity for Spain, and also due to the belief that the Jews were a bad influence to the converts. The Jews that went to Portugal, Navarra, Provence and Morocco, suffered prosecution, violence and new expulsions, and the Kings of Spain allowed the return of those willing to convert until 1499. Those that went to Italy and Constantinople fared better. The economic consequences of the expulsion were negative as the Jews paid increased taxes, lent money to Kings and nobles, and administered properties. Culturally it was an even greater loss.

<h3>Description</h3>
The presence of Charles VIII of France in the Kingdom of Naples scared the Italian princes, who had in a certain way permitted the French King to achieve his goal of settling there almost undisturbed. Venice and Florence were worried about a French hegemony in the peninsula. French military presence wasn't limited to Southern Italy but also to villages of Tuscany and the Papal States, which previously surrendered to Charles VIII in his march towards Naples, strategically located to grant the French military supply line. The Pope, who previously granted the French King military access through the Papal territories and consented his stay in Rome, felt in jeopardy as much as to refuse Charles VIII being proclaimed King of Naples. Also King Ferdinand of Aragon couldn't accept the French presence in a Kingdom where he instead, in spite of Alfons V's testament which assigned Naples to the other Trastamara branch, could be the one to have claims there. The position of Naples was also important for the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean. The Duke of Milan, who decisively affected Charles VIII's decision to settle in Naples, was now alarmed by the presence of French reserve troops deployed in the county of Asti, very close to Milan and at the order of the Duke of Orléans, who had dynastical claims to the Milanese throne. So Venice, Milan, the Pope, Spain and even the Holy Roman Empire (so firmly opposed to the French expansionism in Italy as to join any Anti-French alliance available) consequently formed the Anti-French league in Venice on 31 March 1495. Florence preferred to stay out because of her internal problems caused by Charles VIII's passage and decided to support France instead. Having heard about those arrangements and fearing that the confederates would isolate his army in Italy, Charles VIII decided to return to France for reinforcements leaving his regent in Naples. He had to move his army quickly through the Apennines as to reach the Alps and then safety, but the presence of heavy artilleries and carriages transporting the big loot he accumulated across Italy, slowed his march down. Only at Fornovo on the Taro River, in the Po Valley, Charles VIII finally faced the army of the confederates. Despite having lost all the carriages, he managed to reach the Alps gaining from his expedition to Italy nothing but his army decimated by epidemies.

<h3>Description</h3>
With the French entering Naples, the young King Ferdinando II, also called Ferrandino, had sailed to Sicily to receive the military support of his cousin, Ferdinand II King of Aragon. Starting from his base in Messina he then tried to reconquer his Kingdom with an Aragonese army led by general Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba. After an initial defeat against the French in the battle of Seminara, the King organized a fleet and, supported by the local population which was hostile to the presence of French troops, entered Naples retaking the castles which were still in French hands. Although having successfully helped his cousin Ferrandino, Ferdinand of Aragon distrusted Ferrandino's uncle Federico who succeded to the throne because of lack of Ferrandino's direct descendancy. Federico was a weak monarch whose unhappy diplomatic moves to appease France, even acknowledging his realm as a French fief, and to encourage diplomatic relations with the Turk would let the Kingdom be prey of foreign powers. Ferdinand of Aragon, who didn't deny to disconfess Alfons V's testament to keep the crown of Naples separate from those of Aragon and Sicily, feared that the defense of Naples, crucial to the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean, could no longer be entrusted to his relative. He had to face the difficult choice of either going to war against France or splitting the Kingdom of Naples with them. When Federico refused a marriage between his son Ferrandino, Duke of Calabria, and Ferdinand's niece, Juana de Aragón, King Ferdinand definitively resolved to come to terms with the French King signing the treaty of Granada. The fate of Naples was then written.

<h3>Description</h3>
King Federico III of Naples was unable to oppose much resistance, and the French entered Naples in August 1501. Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba met more resistance in the siege of Taranto, defended by Federico's son Ferdinando. Ferdinando surrendered Taranto to Spain on March 1502, and Fernando of Aragon did not keep Cordoba's promise of personal freedom to him, asking Cordoba to send him to Spain. His father King Federico III had already ceded the Kingdom to Louis XII King of France, who in exchange for it, appointed him Duke of Anjou. Federico III will die in 1504 in France. In 1550 with the death of his son Ferdinando, who was taken captive in Spain, the line of the House of Trastamara Naples will be definitely extinct. But the Kings had neglected to properly divide the regions of the Kingdom, leaving the Principati, the Basilicata and the Capitanata between both parts unassigned. The French denied that Capitanata (a land on which both Apulia and Abruzzi depended for food and flock wintering) was part of Apulia arguing recent administrative usage, and refused to allow the commissaries of Spain to collect the tolls on migrating flocks as the treaty stipulated. Soon incidents were taking place and open war broke out in July 1502. But the lack of decision by the French to attack when they had the advantage, the skill of Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba and the delays of Louis in bringing reinforcements will see the French expelled from Naples in one year. Completely defeated in Naples by Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, Louis XII of France agreed at Blois in October of 1505 to cede his rights over Naples to his relative Germaine de Foix on her marriage to Fernando of Aragon. After the battle of Cerignola on 28 April 1503 Gonzalo Fernández will be remembered as el Gran Capitán. He introduced many of the reforms that would change the way battles were fought for centuries, and lead to the creation of the Spanish Tercios, and also trained most of the next generation of Spanish commanders.

<h3>Description</h3>
Ferrán II decided to attack Mazalquivir (Mers-el-Kebir), the port of Oran (Wahran), to ensure the security of his Italian possessions from Barbary attacks. The Aragonese expedition under the naval command of Ramón de Cardona and land command of the Alcaide de los Donceles captured the fortress after a heavy bombardment. But Mazalquivir was difficult to hold, as it lacked water and had to be provisioned by dangerous sorties or by friendly tribes. Ferrán understood that another expedition to Oran was necessary to complete the task. Command of the expedition was entrusted to Pedro Navarro who landed an army of over 20,000 men and besieged the city. Navarro soon blew the walls with his mines and heavy artillery bombardment, and in the assault the Aragonese inflicted 4000 casualties in the enemy, and conquered the city. Some commanders wanted to push the conquest inland, but Navarro, under orders from the King, refused.

<h3>Description</h3>
Since 1495, Venice had been holding the main ports of Apulia despite Aragonese claims to have them back. With the French invasion of Milan, Venice had acquired Milanese territories east of the Adda River, and upon the fall of Cesare Borgia had also acquired Rimini, Faenza and Ravenna, against the will of Pope Julius II. The Venetians also held Veneto and Friuli, on which Maximilian of Habsburg had imperial claims. In late 1507 Maximilian announced his intention to travel to Italy to receive the imperial investiture from the Pope himself, and in early 1508 he assembled a big army to escort him down to Rome. He requested free passage through Venetian territories, but was told that he would be allowed passage only without his army. Enraged at the answer, Maximilian attacked Venice, but this decision proved unwise: Venice not only routed the imperial army but also seized the imperial cities of Trieste, Gorz and Fiume. A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure, forcing Maximilian to conclude a humiliating three-year truce. With Pope Julius II's assent, Maximilian took the title of 'Emperor-elect', thus breaking the century-old custom that the Holy Roman Emperor had to be crowned by the Pope. Shortly afterward, Venice provided a pretext for war by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza. The Emperor, the King of France and Ferdinand of Aragon gathered in Cambrai in December 1508 to sign a treaty which seemed to be a defensive alliance against the Turk. In reality they meant to form a league to attack Venice and deprive the Serenissima of most of her mainland territories. Pope Julius II, after a renewed Venetian refusal to give the Romagna lands back to the Papacy, ratified the treaty and at the same time proceeded to excommunicate all Venetian citizens. Ferrara and Mantua, each with separate claims to territories held by Venice, joined the league as well. In April 1509 military operations started, and a month later French troops decimated one of the two Venetian armies at the battle of Agnadello. Even though in August 1509 Venice managed to eliminate Mantua from the war, she still faced the collapse of her strategic position and had by February 24, 1510 to accept the papal demands on the cities she had occupied in Romagna. However, Pope Julius II was still not satisfied and demanded that the war be prosecuted until Venice conceded control over their church to the Pope and compensated him for his expenses. The Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity. This opportunity presented itself shortly afterward.

<h3>Description</h3>
Pedro Navarro was left on command of Oran, and in the next season he attacked Bugia (Béjaïa), in the Eastern side of Tlemcen. Navarro disembarked 5,000 men and a train of artillery, and after defeating a far more numerous Berber army, conquered the city sacking it. Since it was still early in the season, Navarro decided to attack Tripoli. An army of 14,000 men was prepared. The city, the strongest in the campaign, was taken by assault, with over 5,000 casualties between the defenders. Immediately Navarro went to Djerba with the intention of capturing the island. After landing, they were ambushed in an oasis where 3,000 soldiers were killed. Navarro therefore returned to Tripoli. The Zayyanid Sultan of Tlemcen, Abu Abdallah Muhammad VIII, worried by the continuous defeats decided to become a vassal of Aragon in 1510.

The Zayyanid Sultan of Tlemcen, Abu Abdallah Muhammad VIII, worried by the continuous defeats decided to become a vassal of Aragon in 1510.

<h3>Description</h3>
Ferrán II had decided upon a policy of North African expansion to provide an alternate route to Sicily, and to squash piracy on the Barbary cost. However the conquest of isolated presidios (fortresses) in the coast had the exact opposite effect. Under the pressure of Aragon, the authority of the Zayyanid rulers of Tlemcen was weakened, and pirates became independent and more active all along the coast. A famous Turkish pirate named Aruj received permission from the Hafsid sultan of Tunis to use the island of Djerba (Gelves) as a base, and he captured Jijelli in 1514 and took over Algiers in 1516 when he defeated the Aragonese. He then killed the local ruler and proclaimed himself Sultan. He was known as Baba Aruj, or Father Aruj. This was translated by the Aragonese as Barbarroja (Barbarossa in Italian, or Redbeard). He became the nightmare of the Aragonese. In 1517 he supported a successful rebellion in Tlemcen, but he was driven out by the Aragonese and killed in 1518. However the balance of power in Tlemcen was shifting towards Algiers, which remained independent under the leadership of Aruj's brother, Khayr ad-Din Barbarossa, who sought the help of the Ottoman Empire.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1510 Venice submitted to the Pope, thus lessening the league of Cambrai. Conditions were hard for Venice, the Republic had to renounce her traditional power to appoint bishops as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venetian territory and was to compensate Pope Julius II for his war expenses needed to recapture the Papal holdings in Romagna, while the Pope accepted the humble request of the Republic for pardon, cancelling the interdict. But the reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French to continue the war against Venice with attacks to her cities in Terraferma. Julius II, in the meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy and formulated plans, both to chase the French out of the Po Valley and to seize the Duchy of Ferrara, a French ally, with the intention to add the territories of Modena, Reggio and Ferrara to the Papal States. In realizing his plan the Pope immediately excommunicated Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, declaring his fief forfeited for his remaining loyal to France, then he gained the military support of Venice, eager to recover her territories lost to the French a armies and hired an army of Swiss mercenaries to attack Milan as to isolate the French armies in Italy. However his plans failed as the French army managed to invade Romagna and occupy the cities of Bologna and Ravenna, supported by the powerful and celebrated artillery of Duke Alfonso d'Este. In addition, in response to Pope's switching sides, Louis XII of France convoked a Schismatic Council at Pisa as to have the 'Warrior Pope' deposed. Pope Julius II, having unsuccessfully pressed the Republic of Florence to refuse hosting the schismatic cardinals, proclaimed the Holy League against France and convoked a Council of his own to meet at the Lateran in Rome. The promise of territorial gains at French expense caused Ferdinand II of Aragon and Emperor Maximilian I to abandon their alliance with the French, and in October 1511, they joined the newly-formed Holy League together with Julius II and the Republic of Venice. In November, Henry VIII of England and the Swiss confederation joined as well.

<h3>Description</h3>
Upon the premature childless death of François Phoebus of Navarre, his sister Catherine succeeded him. This arrangement was opposed by the next male relative, Jean Vicomte de Narbonne who started contesting his niece's and her husband's inheritance in 1494. The war lasted for three years and crippled the whole country until Jean finally submitted in the Peace of Tarbes on September 7th 1497. However, the Vicomtes of Narbonne never really gave up their claim and Jean's son Gaston continued to gather support for it. When Gaston died in battle in 1512, Fernando of Aragon who had married Gaston's sister Germaine inherited the claim. This was of course a long-awaited opportunity for Fernando to complete Spain's possessions on the Iberian Peninsula, and he did not hesitate to invade Navarre. Spanish troops occupied everything south of the Pyrenees within less than a year.

<h3>Description</h3>
After the discovery of America and the new routes opened by Portuguese sailors to India and China, the once very dynamical and mercantile Mediterranean progressively lost its role as the economical heart of Europe. The interest and the money shifted to endeavors across the Atlantic. This was a hard blow to the Crown of Aragon and its Mediterranean-based economy.

<h3>Description</h3>
When the Order of St. John was expelled from Rhodes in 1523, it underwent a crisis. Their possessions were being confiscated all over Europe, by both Catholic and Protestant rulers, their income was shrinking and their recruits stopped coming. They desperately needed a base, preferably by reconquering Rhodes, otherwise an island in the Aegean, but no one would help and Venice actively opposed them. Europe was at war and there was no place for their neutrality. The King of Aragon however came up with a master idea. He offered Malta to the Hospitallers. Malta was difficult to defend from the growing Ottoman power, but the Knights were a tough breed. They would give their lives defending his shipping lines to Sicily. In 1524 the Hospitallers sent a commission to Malta. Their report was very negative. The island could not sustain itself and the defences were very poor. Then Enric I decided to include Tripoli as part of an all or nothing deal. The Knights thought even less of Tripoli. They did not have the resources to upgrade its defenses, but having no other option, the Chapter General decided in 1527 to accept the offer despite the opposition of the French Langues. They still had hopes of recovering Rhodes, but in 1530 they gave up and moved to Malta, taking possession also of Tripoli. From then on, the Aragonese and the Knights of St. John would fight their battles in North Africa together.

<h3>Description</h3>
It was just a matter of time before the Ottomans attacked Malta. In May 1565, a powerful fleet from the Ottomans and their allies the Barbary pirates, arrived to the island and landed an army of 40,000. Against them were 540 knights, 400 Spaniards and 4,000 Maltese. Fort St. Elmo lasted 5 weeks of furious fights until almost all its defenders were killed. By then 600 Spaniards from Sicily had arrived to the city. The fighting continued all summer taking the lives of 5000 defenders with the Turkish loses three times higher, including the famous pirate Dragut. In early September, when the defenders were at their last resistance, help from Spain finally arrived under command of Álvaro de Bazán and García de Toledo. The Turks, low on morale, panicked and abandoned the island.

<h3>Description</h3>
When the Order of St. John was expelled from Rhodes in 1523, it underwent a crisis. Their possessions were being confiscated all over Europe, by both Catholic and Protestant rulers, their income was shrinking and their recruits stopped coming. They desperately needed a base, preferably by reconquering Rhodes, otherwise an island in the Aegean, but no one would help and Venice actively opposed them. Europe was at war and there was no place for their neutrality. The King of Aragon however came up with a master idea. He offered Malta to the Hospitallers. Malta was difficult to defend from the growing Ottoman power, but the Knights were a tough breed. They would give their lives defending his shipping lines to Sicily. In 1524 the Hospitallers sent a commission to Malta. Their report was very negative. The island could not sustain itself and the defences were very poor. Then Enric I decided to include Tripoli as part of an all or nothing deal. The Knights thought even less of Tripoli. They did not have the resources to upgrade its defenses, but having no other option, the Chapter General decided in 1527 to accept the offer despite the opposition of the French Langues. They still had hopes of recovering Rhodes, but in 1530 they gave up and moved to Malta, taking possession also of Tripoli. From then on, the Aragonese and the Knights of St. John would fight their battles in North Africa together.

<h3>Description</h3>
The alliance against the Holy Roman Emperor, signed by the Most Christian King François Ier of France and the Sultan Suleiman of the Ottoman Empire, resulted in attacks by the Turks every time France fought against Aragon. The most destructive raid was the one produced after the invasion of Milan by France in 1542. Barbarossa, on command of a huge Ottoman and Barbary fleet, raided the costs of Italy, joining later a French fleet under command of the Duke of Enghien at Marseilles and both proceeded to attack Nice. At the arrival of Andrea Doria and Alfonso de Avalos, they retreated to Toulon for winter, where the churches were prohibited from ringing their bells, and Christian slaves were openly sold between Turks and pirates. While at Toulon, a fleet was dispatched to sack the coasts of Aragon. After the peace of Crépy between France and Aragon, Barbarossa returned to Istanbul, pillaging the coasts of Tuscany and Naples in the way.

<h3>Description</h3>
After the pact between François Ier of France and the Ottoman Sultan in 1527, Alfons VI found his empire in a difficult situation. The Turks usally sent their fleets to ravage his coasts, coinciding and even coordinating with French attacks. To avoid complete Ottoman control of the Mediterranean, he took Tunis in 1535. The new Governor of Oran, Martín Alonso de Cordoba, the Conde de Alcaudete, was ordered to lead an expedition against Tlemcen which was shifting towards the Ottoman side. At Prevesa, in the Albanian cost, the combined fleets of Aragon, Venice, Genoa and Papal States, under command of Andrea Doria, were defeated by the Ottoman-Barbary fleet under Khayr ad-Din Barbarossa. Although losses were small and mostly Venetian, since Doria refused to fight, its effect was to give supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean to the Ottomans. Besides the expedition of Alcaudete, something needed to be done to maintain Aragonese supremacy, at least in the Western Mediterranean, and so Alfons VI ordered a naval expedition against Al-Djazaúr (Algiers).

<h3>Description</h3>
Taking advantage of the fights between different tribes in Tlemcen, the Conde de Alcaudete, military governor of Aragonese Oran, supported the Banu Rashid to dethrone Muhammad and install his brother Ahmad in 1545. Muhammad sought the help of Hassan Pasha, ruler of Al-Djazaúr and son of Khayr ad-Din Barbarossa, and was restored with the help of the Turks. Alcaudete attacked in 1547, but was driven back by the Turks. Meanwhile, in Morocco, the pro-Turkish Wattasid Sultan Ahmad was defeated by the Sa'did Muhammad al-Shaykh (al-Mahdi), who then invaded Tlemcen putting an end to 300 years of Zayyanid rule there. The Turkish reaction under Agha Hasan Quru however drove them out. Tlemcen was under Turkish control, but disputed by Moroccans and the Aragonese.

<h3>Description</h3>
The fall of Tlemcen into Ottoman hands in 1551 put Aragonese Oran in a mortal danger. Martín Alonso de Cordoba, Conde de Alcaudete, military governor of Oran, entered into an alliance with the Sultan of Morocco, Muhammad al-Shaykh, to drive the Turks from Tlemcen. However the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman dispatched spies that assassinated Muhammad al-Shaykh in 1557. Having lost this ally for an attack on Algiers, Alcaudete marched with an army of 12,000 on Mustaghanim (Mostaganem) the next year. But tribes and the Turkish forces of Hasan Quru totalling over 70,000 men defeated them. Alcaudete was killed, and his son and most of the army were captured. The next year many of them would abjure from their beliefs to escape slavery. Tlemcen disappeared as a country, firmly in the hands of the Pashas of Al-Djazaúr who were named by the Ottoman Empire. Tripoli was lost in 1551, Bugia in 1555, and Tunis in 1570. Aragon had lost the North African game, but would successfully defend Oran and Melilla from recurrent attacks for centuries.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Knights Hospitallers took care of the defense of Tripoli after its cession by Alfons VI for over 20 years. Provisioned by the Viceroy of Sicily and with the help of a Aragonese garrison, the Order even considered moving their see there. However in 1551 they were attacked by a huge Ottoman army under command of Sinan Pasha and Dragut. There were very few Knights in Tripoli, and the Aragonese soldiers from Calabria refused to fight, and so Tripoli was surrendered almost without fight. In 1560 the Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valette enticed the Viceroy of Sicily, Juan de la Cerda, Duke of Medinaceli to attempt its recovery, but the expedition, approved by Enric II, was a complete failure, since Tripoli had been converted into a stronghold by huge Ottoman defensive works under the direction of Dragut.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1565 the help of Enric II was required by the Hospitallers to defend Malta against a combined assault by the Ottomans and Barbary pirates. The victory was very important because it put a clear limit to how far could the Ottoman Empire capable project its power. However the Ottoman Empire was at its peak, as the capture of Tunis in 1569 demonstrated. The capture of Cyprus in 1571, triggered the formation of a Holy League, mainly formed by Aragon, Venice and Papal States, with the combined fleet under command of Don Juan de Austria. The interests of Venice and Aragon were very different: Venice wanted to recover Cyprus, and Aragon wanted to recover her North African presidios, and they could only agree in fighting the Ottoman Navy. The ensuing battle at Lepanto was the biggest naval battle in modern times with over 32,000 casualties (by comparison Trafalgar had only 3,000), 25,000 of them on the Ottoman side which was almost completely destroyed. News of the victory were extremely well received by the Christians that had suffered from Ottoman and Barbary piracy. Although the Ottomans rebuilt their fleet and recaptured Tunis a second time in 1574, their naval supremacy in the Mediterranean was destroyed forever.

<h3>Description</h3>
After the disaster of Mustaghanim, in 1558, the military governor of Oran was Alonso de Córdoba, the new Conde de Alcaudete. He ransomed his father's body for 2000 ducats and his brother Martín in 1561 for 23,333 ducats that he obtained from a pillaging expedition into Moorish territory. In 1563, after the failure of Medinaceli in Tripoli, and the loss of Djerba, where Dragut made a pyramid with the skulls of the garrison, the Beylerbey Hassan Pasha, son of Barbarossa, decided to attack Oran. The Ottoman fleet had 32 galleys and 3 French round ships. The army was constituted of 1,000 Spahis, 15,000 Janissaries, and over 12,000 Kabyles and Arabs, contributed by the Sultan of Koukou and the Banu-Abba tribe. The assaults started in April on Mazalquivir, defended by Martín de Córdoba and 200 men. Time after time the Muslims were repelled. The son of the Sultan of Koukou died, Hassan was wounded, but their troops reached the walls of the fortification. On the last assault, on June 7, Martín was also wounded. Then news arrived that a powerful Christian fleet under command of Gian Andrea Doria and Francisco de Mendoza was on its way. Hassan Pasha called for an all out assault, but the Janissaries refused, and he had to escape, leaving behind all his artillery, and having lost 4,000 men, four galleys and the three French transports. Only 130 survivors remained in Mazalquivir. Maintenance of Oran, however, was becoming a burden. The Council of State asked for reports to study the possibility of leaving Oran and keeping only Mazalquivir, but without the first, the second was untenable, and so it was decided in 1574 to keep both. A great investment was made to upgrade the fortifications, designed by Antonelli, and the castle of Santa Cruz was built in 1577.

<h3>Description</h3>
Enric II just did not have the money to pursue a North African conquest, but the rebellion of the Moriscos in 1569, at a time when Tunis was conquered for the Ottomans by the famous pirate and Beylerbey of Algiers, Uluj Ali, made him painfully aware of the dangers of ignoring that front. With great effort, the Moriscos rebellion was put down and the Ottoman fleet defeated at Lepanto. But although Tunis was briefly recovered, it was quickly lost again due to lack of resources. But he was not alone in having problems. The Ottomans, defeated at Malta and Lepanto, found themselves also overstretched due to the demands of their conflicts with Persia. Under these circumstances, Enric II and Murad III negotiated a series of truces between 1577 and 1581. In these truces Enric II renounced the former Aragonese conquests in North Africa, while the Ottoman sultan renounced Oran and would not lend help to the Moriscos. The peace between Aragon and the Ottoman Empire would be permanent, and would allow both empires to abandon the Mediterranean, which was left in the hands of the Barbary pirates, periodically checked by the European navies.

<h3>Description</h3>
During the 17th century, due to the difficulties in the rural life, gangs of bandits abounded in the interior of Catalonia and Valencia, specially in mountanious and densely forested zones. They were usually divided in two rival groups: the 'nyerros' and the 'cadells' according to their political ideas. The most famous of these bandits, origin of many legends, was Joan de Serrallonga, and his faithful fiancée Joana Torrelles. These gangs were sometimes very dangerous and caused havoc to the economy and trade of the country.

<h3>Description</h3>
After the death of his father Juan, Fernando and his wife Isabel became also Kings of Aragon with the same agreement as the one for Castile, they will both have the same powers, but Fernando will have precedence and exclusivity over the crown. Europe was fascinated by the Iberian experiment, where more than the marriage of the Kings, it appeared that the countries were marrying in equal terms. The new Kings soon showed the power of a strong monarchy, administering justice everywhere, subjugating the rebellious nobles, reorganizing the military orders, and introducing church reforms. The problems of instability, anarchy and banditry that have plagued Castile and Aragon were solved. The city rights were restored and the high nobility put under control and balanced by the increase in numbers of the lower nobility.

<h3>Description</h3>
When the Order of St. John was expelled from Rhodes in 1523, it underwent a crisis. Their possessions were being confiscated all over Europe, by both Catholic and Protestant rulers, their income was shrinking and their recruits stopped coming. They desperately needed a base, preferably by reconquering Rhodes, otherwise an island in the Aegean, but no one would help and Venice actively opposed them. Europe was at war and there was no place for their neutrality. The King of Aragon however came up with a master idea. He offered Malta to the Hospitallers. Malta was difficult to defend from the growing Ottoman power, but the Knights were a tough breed. They would give their lives defending his shipping lines to Sicily. In 1524 the Hospitallers sent a commission to Malta. Their report was very negative. The island could not sustain itself and the defences were very poor. Then Enric I decided to include Tripoli as part of an all or nothing deal. The Knights thought even less of Tripoli. They did not have the resources to upgrade its defenses, but having no other option, the Chapter General decided in 1527 to accept the offer despite the opposition of the French Langues. They still had hopes of recovering Rhodes, but in 1530 they gave up and moved to Malta, taking possession also of Tripoli. From then on, the Aragonese and the Knights of St. John would fight their battles in North Africa together.

<h3>Description</h3>
Alfons of Aragon, after being adopted by Giovanna of Anjou-Durazzo, arrived at the Kingdom of Naples with the intention of being recognised as its legitimate ruler, due mainly to his descent from the last Hohenstaufen King of Sicily, and not due to the will of a member of an usurping dynasty, the House of Anjou. He wanted to take control of Naples immediately without waiting for the Queen's death. He soon imprisoned Caracciolo, Giovanna's lover, but he failed to capture the Queen. Muzio Attendolo Sforza, the Neapolitan condottiero in the service of the Pope, informed that Giovanna was in great danger, went hastily to Naples and rescued her. It was then easy for the Pope to convince the Queen to adopt Louis III of Anjou, Count of Provence, instead of Alfons of Aragon. Taking advantage of the absence of Alfons due to his problems in Aragon, and with the military help of Visconti, Duke of Milan and Signore of Genoa, the Aragonese were expelled from Naples, and Giovanna appointed Louis as Duke of Calabria, the heir's title. Louis moved his court to Cosenza to arrange his stay in Italy.

<h3>Description</h3>
Giovanna of Anjou-Durazzo was not destined to be Queen, and when she found herself with the crown of Naples on her head after the death of her brother, she refused to give up her previous dissolute life. She soon started to yield the power to whoever happened to be her current paramour. The nobility was restless and conspirative. Pope Martinus V, as his predecessors, wanted to see Naples in the firm hands of a trusted man, but as a previous arranged marriage to Jean of Bourbon had failed, and Giovanna was now 50 years old, he decided to invest Louis III of Anjou, Count of Provence, of the junior branch of the House of Anjou, with claims to Naples. Martinus and Louis recruited the help of Neapolitan condottiero Muzio Attendolo, also known as 'lo Sforza'. When Sforza's army invaded Naples, Giovanna turned to Alfons V of Aragon, who had also distant claims to the crown of Naples, and in exchange for his help, adopted him as heir. Alfons arrived to Naples with his forces, and made Braccio da Montone, Sforza's greatest rival, commander of the Neapolitan armies.

<h3>Description</h3>
Aragon was the first nation in the world to create a permanent specific naval infantry unit in 1537. This was the Old Company of the Sea of Naples composed by harquebusiers to fight on board galleys. In the winter of 1564 spies told of a powerful Ottoman fleet being readied in Constantinople. On May 18, 1565 their target was revealed when the Janissaries landed in Malta. From the beginning of May Aragon had been gathering her force. Finally, on August 25, the Viceroy of Sicily, García de Toledo, gave the order to depart, arriving at Malta on September 7, forcing the Ottomans to lift their siege on the exact same day they had scheduled their final full-out assault on the few surviving defenders. Had they arrived one day later, Malta would have been lost. It was clear that a reaction time of four months was not acceptable and that Aragon could not project her power far away unless a permanent force capable of landing and conducting battles that could be quickly deployed was assigned to the Navy. So in February 1566 the Tercio de la Armada del Mar Oceano, or Tercio of the Navy of the Ocean Sea, also known as Tercio de Figueroa for its first commander, was created with 6,700 soldiers. Harquebusiers from this unit were the first to assault the Sultana, the Ottoman flagship in the battle of Lepanto and, as a reward, its commander Lope de Figueroa was given the commission to inform the King of the victory.

<h3>Description</h3>
After his release from Milan, Alfons of Aragon returned to Naples, where his brother Pedro had conquered Gaeta. Naples was defended by Isabelle of Lorraine with the support of Pope Eugenius IV. For three years Alfons conducted as much a diplomatic war as a military one, gaining allies to his cause from the Neapolitan nobles. In 1438, René of Anjou paid a huge ransom to Burgundy for his release, and arrived in the Kingdom, but since he had exhausted his funds his allies abandoned him and he had to retreat to Naples. A long siege was then established, during which the Infante Don Pedro was killed by a chance shot to the great grief of his brother. The support of the Genoese fleet allowed René to sustain the besieged capital with success until 1 June 1442, when 300 Aragonese well-armed men entered the town through an open drain accessible during the dry season, revealed to Alfons' son Ferrante by some prisoners. After several hours of fighting and in spite of the stealthy move inside the city walls, Naples withstood the Aragonese and Alfons was forced to retreat to Sicily. After recovering the rest of the Kingdom, René entered the capital in triumph the year after. Pope Eugenius IV, very happy for the Angevin success, invested René as King of Naples and Sicily thus declaring Alfons of Aragon in unlawful possession of the Sicilian island.

<h3>Description</h3>
Alfons VI had inherited a North African situation that was turning into a nightmare. The Ottomans were calling to the doors of Vienna, and in Africa they had taken over Egypt, and with the help of the Barbary pirates, they were taking over Kingdom after Kingdom, destroying the policy of alliances that his grandfather Fernando had established. He could not let them reach the Straits of Gibraltar. Worse still, they entered an alliance with France, so he was facing war simultaneously in all fronts. To add to that, the Aragonese presidios (fortresses) in Africa were very difficult to defend. When Barbarossa conquered Tunis in 1534, the fleeing Pasha al-Hassan went to the Aragonese court and asked for help in exchange for vassalage. Alfons VI could not let the Ottomans or their allies come any closer to Aragon and Italy. A huge armada was assembled and he decided to lead it in person.

<h3>Description</h3>
Pope Eugenius refused to invest Alfons as King of Naples and threatened to declare him in unlawful possession of Naples, Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia. Alfons threatened back with his support for an anti-Pope, Felix V, chosen at the Council of Basel, and Eugenius accepted to invest him in exchange for his support as the genuine Pope and help against the Turks that never materialized. Ferrante was named Prince of Calabria, and the Neapolitans were pleased that their Kingdom was not going to be incorporated to Aragon. Alfons, who as a Castilian had always felt a foreigner in Barcelona, never returned to Aragon, and his court in Naples was filled with the splendor of the Renaissance.

<h3>Description</h3>
In accordance with his father's will, Ferdinando succeeded Alfonso I on the throne of Naples. Ferdinando I, also called Don Ferrante, was the natural son of Alfonso V of Aragon and I of Sicily and Naples. In order to arrange a good future to his bastard son, King Alfonso had him married in 1444 to Isabella of Chiaramonte, a feudal heiress of remarkable feudal possessions in Southern Italy and granddaughter of Maria d'Enghien, Queen consort of Ladislao, the last Angevin King of Naples. Establishing there the newly born Neapolitan branch of the Trastamara Dynasty, the Kingdom of Naples will be our most faithful ally.

<h3>Description</h3>
The confrontation between Aragon and the Sultan of the Ottomans was reaching Tlemcen at a delicate point, when dynastic fights were shaking the Zayyanids. The Conde de Alcaudete, military governor of Oran, joined in 1535 with tribal chief Ibn Radwan to help Zayyanid prince Abdallah overthrow his older brother Muhammad V. The expedition, including 600 Aragonese soldiers, was almost completely wiped out by the Banu Rashid tribe. However, probably because the Aragonese had taken Tunis, Sultan Muhammad agreed to pay tribute to Oran in exchange for Aragonese protection. Six years later, the expedition of more than four hundred ships sent against Barbarossa in Algiers departed too late in the season and, surprised by a storm, lost one fourth of its effectives and had to retreat. Overstretched because of the wars against France Alfons VI did not have the resources to maintain the hegemony in the Western Mediterranean against the Ottomans.

<h3>Description</h3>
Giovanna of Anjou-Durazzo was not destined to be Queen, and when she found herself with the crown of Naples on her head after the death of her brother, she refused to give up her previous dissolute life. She soon started to yield the power to whoever happened to be her current paramour. The nobility was restless and conspirative. Pope Martinus V, as his predecessors, wanted to see Naples in the firm hands of a trusted man, but as a previous arranged marriage to Jean of Bourbon had failed, and Giovanna was now 50 years old, he decided to invest Louis III of Anjou, Count of Provence, of the junior branch of the House of Anjou, with claims to Naples. Martinus and Louis recruited the help of Neapolitan condottiero Muzio Attendolo, also known as 'lo Sforza'. When Sforza's army invaded Naples, Giovanna turned to Alfons V of Aragon, who had also distant claims to the crown of Naples, and in exchange for his help, adopted him as heir. Alfons arrived to Naples with his forces, and made Braccio da Montone, Sforza's greatest rival, commander of the Neapolitan armies.

<h3>Description</h3>
After the death of Giovanna of Anjou without natural heirs, a war of succession for the Kingdom of Naples broke out between the two claimants, René of Anjou and Alfons of Aragon, both designated heirs in two different times by Giovanna. Filippo Maria Visconti of Milan, also Signore of Genoa, preoccupied with the increasing Aragonese influence in the Mediterranean sea trade routes as much as in the Italian peninsula, decided to support the Angevins. Alfons of Aragon was defeated and captured by a Genovese fleet at the battle of Ponza in 1435. Transferred to Milan, Alfons succeeded in gaining Visconti's favour to his cause against the French Angevins. He convinced Filippo Maria that a French presence in Italy could be against the interests of Milan since the House of Orléans had never hidden its dynastic claims on the Duchy of Milan. But Genoa, a bitter rival of Aragon during centuries of dispute over Sardinia, Corsica, and the control of the Western Mediterranean trade, was appalled by Visconti's sudden change of sides, and immediately asked for admission in the Venetian-Florentine league against her former suzerain.
