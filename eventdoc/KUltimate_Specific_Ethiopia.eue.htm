<h3>Description</h3>
The Copts, the Miaphysite Christian population of Egypt, were subjected to oppression by Muslims. The Umayyad rulers taxed Christians at a higher rate than Muslims, driving merchants towards Islam and undermining the economic base of the Coptic Church. The Fatimids adopted a largely favourable attitude towards the Christians. The Ayyubids and Mamluks resumed persecution of the Copts, seeking to convert them to Islam. <br /> The Ethiopians, taking advantage of the weakness of the Egyptians, launched a military campaign to defend the Christians. It succeeded when the Solomonic army laid siege to and took Cairo. Although the Copts are mainly settled down the Nile, it is in Cairo that a great heritage is found. Works of Arab sages, geographical maps, and talented people fell into the hands of the Ethiopians, who thus re-established contact with the wider outside world.

<h3>Description</h3>
Ethiopia was an Empire spanning a vast area populated by numerous tribal peoples that did not follow the state religion of the Empire, and few Solomonid Emperors can be considered to have controlled their whole Empire at any time. Beside the endless power struggles, religious strife and encroachments of Muslims, Ethiopian Emperors are also known for their campaigns against the followers of other religions within their Empire and on its borders.<br /> Yeshaq I is remembered for his campaigns against the Falashas and invasions of Shanqella region. The Falashas were (still are) Jewish Ethiopians. Their origin is still debated, whether they are a lost tribe of Israel or Ethiopians converted from an archaic form of Christianity to Judaism. In any case they constituted a likely target to the beleaguered Orthodox Christians surrounded by Islam. The continuous campaigns against the Falashas were successful in greatly reducing their numbers. Shanqella is an inhospitable region in western Ethiopia inhabited by black-skinned pagans of Sudanese origin. With its backwards and disorganized inhabitants, this region was a frequent proving and raiding ground of Ethiopian Emperors.

<h3>Description</h3>
Zara Yaqob (the seed of Jacob) was a prince by the third wife of late Emperor Hasei Dawit (David) II. He was far removed from the throne, but the death of several of his half-brothers and one of his nephews left him as the best candidate, since the inheritance to the throne of Solomon does not follow a strict rule, and the heir can be chosen between all the descendants of the late Emperor. Upon ascending to the throne in 1434, according to tradition the prince chose a new name as emperor, Kwestantinos, in imitation of the Byzantine emperor. Two years later he was crowned and consacrated at Aksum, the old capital, as Neguse Negest (King of Kings, or Emperor), receiving also his throne name, Amda Seyum (the pillar of Zion). For his second wife he married the daughter of the Ethiopian Muslim King of Hadiya. After her conversion to Orthodoxy she received the empress name of Eleni, also in imitation of the Byzantine empress. Both Kwestantinos and Eleni would lead Ethiopia to the pinnacle of her power at the expense of the Kingdoms within the empire.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Christians in Ethiopia had been resisting Islam for seven centuries. They were helped by the mountainous topography of their country and by the fact that none of their Muslim neighbours was specially powerful. However over the centuries, Muslim faith had infiltrated Ethiopia to the point that seven of its Kingdoms had become Muslim: Ifat, Dawaro, Arbabini, Hadiya, Shakara, Bale and Dara. With the rise in power of Adal, Ethiopia became subject to periodic invasions, that were made extremely dangerous because many Muslim Ethiopians would side with the invader. That was the case of sultan Shihab Badlay, known as the Beast (Awen) Badlay, who in one campaing wrestled Bale from Ethiopia, and in another tried to do the same with Dawaro. Zara Yaqob met the challenge, and at the battle of Gomit it is told that he trespassed Badlay's neck with his lance. He then ordered his foe's body cut in pieces that he sent to all the cities in the Kingdom. With the recovery of Bale, and the crushing of Adal and her allies, Ethiopia had bough time.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Ethiopian Tewahedo Orthodox Church was invited to participate as part of the delegation of the Patriarchate of Alexandria in the Council of Florence, that attempted the reunion of the Eastern and Western churches. The Ethiopian delegates had not arrived in Florence until 1441, and they were very surprised when everybody asked them about a Prester John that was clearly not one of the many titles of the King of Kings. Afterwards Zara Yaqob took the opportunity to send another diplomatic mission to Europe in 1450. He obtained from Pope Nicholas V the dedication of St. Stefano Rotondo as an Ethiopian Church in Rome. He also communicated with Alfonso V of Aragon, then champion of Christians in the Oriental Mediterranean, asking for a group of artisans. Alfonso was sympathetic, but asked for guaranties of safe arrival since a previous group, solicited in times of Yeshaq, had all perished at the hands of Muslims during the trip. As for the council itself, it adopted a union of Catholics and Copts that condemned the practices of the Sabbath and circumcision. This led to the isolation of the Ethiopian Church.

<h3>Description</h3>
A legal code written in the XIII century by a Christian Coptic of Egypt in Arabic, based on Roman, Byzantine and Ecclesiatical law, was translated on the orders of Zara Yaqob in 1450. He then started applying parts of it to his Kingdom, and for example appointed legal administrators to decide which cases were to be solved by local governors and which by central government. The measures were very succesful, and the code received the name of ''Laws of the Kings'' or Fetha Negest. In 1563 it will become the constitution of Ethiopia until 1931. The Fetha Negest was a cornerstone of the Feudal system that characterized imperial Ethiopia until its end.

<h3>Description</h3>
After many years of violent internal divisiveness between clergy on issues of Ethiopian Orthodox Church dogma, Zara Yakob lead a successful campaign to normalize church doctrine on issues such as the Sabbath and circumcision. In 1450, he held the Council of Mitmaq, in the hopes that the two abunas (bishops) and all the other major clergy branches would set down a unified church dogma.

<h3>Description</h3>
In some aspects, Zara Yaqob was a great reformer, but what really defined Ethiopia was its religion, and the Negus was a profoundly religious man. Over centuries of isolation, with only a tenuous connection with the Patriarch in Alexandria, the Orthodox in Ethiopia had become split over several questions. Zara Yaqob sought to unify also the Ethiopian Church and imposed the cult of the Virgin Mary in all the churches. He indefatigably prosecuted other religions and all forms of deviations and heresies, to the point of putting to death three of his own daughters (he had over 54 offspring) together with many others on suspicion of idolatry. The example strongly impressed his subjects, that from then on considered him a saint.

<h3>Description</h3>
The imperial court and the army numbered several thousands, and no place in Ethiopia could support their needs for food and firewood for more than four months, and therefore the emperors kept an itinerant court that could not return to the same place for 10 years, to allow for its recovery. But one night, a month after a group of heretics had been stoned to death, a bright light appeared in the sky. Interpreting the visit of Halley's Comet as God's approval, Zara Yaqob decided to place his capital on that particular spot. He built two churches and a palace, creating the first capital of Ethiopia, Debre Berhan. The city continued to flourish for a quarter of a century, until Yaqob's son, Baeda Maryam, decided to resume itinerancy. Afterwards Debre Berhan turned into a small village.

<h3>Description</h3>
In his later years, Zara Yaqob became increasingly despotic and paranoid. He started killing anybody that opposed him. The suspicion that his family wanted to remove him was based in an attempted coup by his son Galawdewos and his Ras Bitwodad (Grand Duke) Iyasus in 1437 that resulted in their imprisonment. However in his later years, he started to become suspicious of everybody, and he ended ordering the beating of several of his sons, daughters and one of his wives, Empress Seyun Mogassa, who died as a result. The matter was further complicated because she was the mother of the heir. Although the church was able to repair the rift between father and son, the death of the mother of the future negus would have important consequences, as she had an important role to fulfill in the imperial court.

<h3>Description</h3>
Dobe'a were primitive nomadic people who inhabited the northeastern part of Ethiopia and bordering parts of Adal sultanate. Nomadic cattle herding and banditry were there only two professions, and the latter caused the decisive campaign of Emperor Baeda Maryam against Dobe'a. First invasion into Dobe'a lands proved fruitless as the crafty nomads were able to flee and hide from the Emperor's troops. This failure prompted Baeda Maryam to seek aid from his vassals. Despite their great loyalty in this campaign, probably because they too were threatened by Dobe'a raids, the camapaign suffered a sound defeat when the Dobe'a were finally found. Only when the furious Emperor called his elite regiment, the Royal Eagle, did the campaign turn from disaster into success and the Dobe'a were broken. Baeda Maryam mobilized his governors to pursue the fleeing non-combatants. Many Dobe'a were slain during those pursuits and massive herds of cattle captured.

<h3>Description</h3>
Baeda Maryam was unable to hold together the far-flung empire his father left him. Some of the outlying provinces recently conquered began to grow restive. The feudal lords whom Zara Yaqob had only ephemerally brought under central control reasserted their regional authority, and the senior clergy relapsed into some of the old-established ways of conduct and ecclesiastical organization.

He moved his court to the south for campaigns against the Muslims in Dawaro and Bale. His successful campaigns brought a short-lived peace with Adal, which he used to pursue campaigns against the Falasha in the north.

<h3>Description</h3>
After their defeat at the hands of Baeda Maryam, the Dobe'a were forced to convert to Christianity and beg the Emperor for pardon. The Emperor in turn returned their cattle, supplementing it with others from the southern provinces of Wej and Genz and stationed soldiers in their country. He further built a church in Dobe'a country dedicated to the Virgin Mary and planted orange trees, lemon trees, and vines in the area, in fulfillment of his earlier declaration. Baeda Maryam soon returned to the Dobe'a country and appointed governors and ''regulated the social condition of the people,'' as well as encouraging the celebration of the death of the Virgin Mary every January, upon which occasion he distributed bread, tela (beer), and tej (a type of honey wine/mead) to the people. He further ordered that the Dobe'a become cultivators, as opposed to bandits and left the country for the last time.

<h3>Description</h3>
Nicolт Brancaleon was a Venetian monk who came to Ethiopia with a goal of converting their greatest Emperor, Zara Yaqob, to Catholicism. Unfortunately for him, Nicolт was a great painter and Ethiopian Emperors had a tradition of forbidding skilled foreign missionaries and explorers to leave Ethiopia. Nicolт Brancaleon founded a studio and quickly became the foremost icon and fresco painter and illustrator of religious books. His best known work is the controversial fresco Madonna and Child at the Church of Atronsa Maryam which was destroyed by the Oromo in 1704. His works were still being discovered in Ethiopia in 20th century. After Nicolт's arrival, at least 17 more skilled Italians were imprisoned at the Emperor's court.

Emperor Eskander ruled in the shadow of Queen Mother Eleni. His premature death at the age of 22 lead to a civil war for the throne. While the court kept the Emperor's death secret, Zasillus, a major noble of the realm, marched his army to Amba Geshen and freed Eskander's brother, Na'od, to proclaim him the new Emperor. Another noble, Tekle Kristos, remained at the court and declared Eskander's son, Amda Seyon II, the Emperor. Zasillus and Na'od were defeated in the first battle, but the war continued for 6 months and ended in Amda Seyon's death and Na'od's succession to the imperial throne.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1487 Joao II of Portugal ordered Bartolomeu Dias around Africa by sea, but he also ordered his trusted spymaster and diplomat, Pкro da Covilhг, to reach India and the Kingdom of Prester John by land. Pкro da Covilhг spoke fluent arabic, and with a companion travelled to Mecca. From there he travelled alone to Goa and Calicut, learning about currents, winds and the origen of the different spices. He then returned to Cairo. From there he forwarded his information together with advice on the best sea-route to India to his King, before continuing to Aden, Ormuz, and Saylac, in the coast of Adal. He finally arrived to Ethiopia in 1490, being well received by Emperor Eskander. After four years of stay, he was preparing his departure, with a proposal of an alliance from the Emperor of Ethiopia to the King of Portugal, when Eskander died. He was succeded by his brother Na'od, after the death of his son. Na'od informed Pкro da Covilhг that he would have to remain in Ethiopia for the rest of his life according to the custom of the Kingdom, but rewarded him lavishly and named him court advisor.

<h3>Description</h3>
Medieval Nubia was divided onto two Kingdoms. The northern, known as Makkura or Makuria with its capital at Dongola reached its zenith at the end of the first millennium. It was eventually destroyed and conquered by the growing Mamluk state in 14th century, though some small Christian pockets like the Kingdom of Dotawo survived well into 15th century. In contrast to well known Makuria, the history of southern Nubian Kingdom of Alodia or Alwa, with capital at Soba, is almost completely unknown. The only thing that we can be sure is that it preserved its political and cultural independence for much longer. In the 15th century, the rulers of Alodia entered into an alliance with Ethiopia to reverse Islamisation. After the humiliation of the Mamluks, relations between the two Christian states became very close, and the Nubian kings swore allegiance to the Ethiopians. When a confederation of Muslim tribes called Funj tried to conquer Alodia, they were defeated by the combined forces of Christians. It is not surprising that Nubia was to become Ethiopian territory one day, and Nubian culture is experiencing a new heyday.

<h3>Description</h3>
The lavish curch of Mekane Selassie, chartered by Emperor Na'od, was a great and lengthy project. It was only finished during the late years of reign of Emperor Anbasa Segad, aka Lebna Dengel, son of Na'od, in 1530. Sadly, the church existed for only about a year as it was destroyed by Muslim invaders from Adal on November 3rd 1531 together with many other Orthodox Christian churches in Amhara region.

<h3>Description</h3>
King Manuel of Portugal was very interested in preventing spice trade through the Red Sea. In 1520 a Portuguese fleet arrived and bombed Saylac, the port of Adal. They then proceeded to Massawa, the port of Ethiopia, where the Portuguese ambassadors dissembarked. They were prepared to sign an alliance with Ethiopia, but their timing was bad. Almost centenary Eleni had been dismissed, and her step great-grandson, Emperor Dawit II, better known as Lebna Dengel had just killed his main enemy, Imam Mahfuz of Adal. He was continuing a series of succesful campaigns against restless Muslims inside Ethiopia. Everybody was convinced that the Muslim menace had been checked, perhaps for good. Lebna Dengel gave his excuses to the ambassadors but said that Eleni's envoy lacked the authority to sign alliances. After a few years in the country, the ambassadors said goodbye to Pкro da Covilhг, who was now too old to travel, and left.

<h3>Description</h3>
It was too bad that Lebna Dengel had dismissed the Portuguese ambassadors in 1526, because the next year and without warning Adal had started a war like no other in the history of Ethiopia. Lead by a mysterious warrior, that the Ethiopians called Graс (Left-handed), and his men called Ahmad al-Fath (the Conqueror), the armies of Adal had been trained in Ottoman tactics, and were armed with flintlock firearms. The Ethiopians were great warriors. Raised in the highlands, they are one of the strongest populations on earth, and their armies were 5 to 10 times superior in numbers. Yet the only thing that they could do against the modern armies of Adal was to make them pay a hefty price for their victories. So they suffered a great defeat at the Awash river in the battle of Shimbra Kure in 1529. Lebna Dengel had 16,000 cavalry and 200,000 infantry against Ahmad 560 cavalry and 12,000 soldiers. Although the Ethiopians were able to kill 5,000 soldiers of Adal, their loses were much higher. Afterwards Ahmad penetrated deep into the highlands, attacking Dawaro and Shewa in 1531, then Amhara, Lasta, Bale, Hadya, Sidama and the Gurage. With half of former Ethiopia under his control, in 1535 Ahmad invaded Tigray in the North, sacking the sacred city of Aksum and destroying the Cathedral were the emperors had been crowned for centuries. But the worst part was the damage inflicted to the people of Ethiopia and Adal by Ahmad, that would change their demography forever. To finance his military campaign against his bigger neighbour, Ahmad used a scorched earth tactic, laying waste to the land and selling every Ethiopian he could capture, Muslim or Christian, as a slave. No Christian priest or nun was left alive by him. Lebna Dengel, outmaneuvered and out-musketed, fled from one province to another, trying to organize the resistance. There was no possibility of a peace agreement, as Ahmad was bent on the destruction of the Christian country. His elder son, Fiqtor, was killed in battle, and the youngest, Menas, was captured and sent as a slave to the Ottoman overlord of Yemen. In desperation, Lebna Dengel sent a plee for help to the King of Portugal. In doing that, he saved his country, but he would not see the result, as he died on the run, exhausted and miserable in 1540.

<h3>Description</h3>
When the Portuguese finally arrived, Ethiopia was in the verge of disintegration. The young Emperor Gelawdewos (Claudius) was on hiding with just a handful of loyals. His mother the Empress Sabla Wengel was under siege at the mountain of Debre Damo. The King of Portugal had sent Cristovгo da Gama, son of famous explorer Vasco da Gama and brother of the Viceroy of India, Estevгo da Gama. He came with 400 soldiers and 1000 arquebuses, plus some small cannons, but in Africa they were the equivalent of a full army. They didn't lose time and defeated Ahmad Graс three times in 1541. After the rainy season they met him again overconfident, but Ahmed had petitioned help to the Ottoman bey of Yemen, Zebid Pasha, offering vassalage, and he was granted 900 Turkish soldiers and additional arms. At the battle of Wofla, on August 28, 1542, the Portuguese were defeated by the far superior army of Ahmad. Over half of them were killed, and the wounded Cristovгo was captured, tortured and eventually beheaded. Believing the Portuguese destroyed, Ahmed dismissed 600 of the Ottomans to other duties, but was then confronted by the remaining Portuguese and the army of Gelawdewos, rearmed with the stored weapons. The battle of Wayna-Daga on February 21, 1543, was initially indecisive, but the Portuguese had sworn to avenge their leader, and singling out Ahmad, killed him. His army fell in confusion and was completely destroyed. The remaining of the forces of Adal abandoned Ethiopia and fell back to Harar. The war continued, now favorable to Ethiopia, and Bale was recovered.

<h3>Description</h3>
Fasilidas spent most of his long reign enmeshed in a long-term controversy about the nature of Christ, an issue the Jesuits had raised in questioning Miaphysite theology. The church hierarchy and the more traditional monastic orders followed the Alexandrian position that Christ's human nature had become perfect through its union (Tewahedo) with the divine, from which it had become inseparable. The more fundamental Ewostathians, especially those in Gojam, believed that the unction (Qebat) of the Holy Ghost, had acted to combine the two natures of Christ, thereby making him the Son of God and part of the Trinity. In 1654, at a church council convened in Gonder, the emperor, as the head of the church, therefore came down on the side of the unctionists. His decision was well received among the Oromo Christians but alienated most of the Amhara nobility.

<h3>Description</h3>
Despite their severe defeat, and the sacking of Harar in 1550, Adal regrouped under the leadership of Ahmad's nephew, Nur ibn Mujtahid. In 1556 he launched a two front coordinated attack with Ottoman help. The Ottomans, leaded by Ozdemur Pasha, conquered Massawa, the best port of the Red Sea, and the only one the Ethiopians had, but their attempt to reach the highlands failed against the determined resistance of Gelawdewos. The attack by Nur was an even worse failure, taking the life of the last of the Walashma sultans of Adal, Barakat. However Emperor Gelawdewos lost his life in battle and his head was taken to Harar. The loss of the port of Massawa to the Ottomans was a worse catastrophe for Ethiopia. They lost control of their trade, they could no longer buy firearms, and anybody traveling from the outside to Ethiopia had to do so in disguise. Never had been Ethiopia so isolated from the outside world.

<h3>Description</h3>
The pity state to which Ethiopia had been reduced by the concerted attacks of Adal, the Ottomans and the Oromo, was further complicated by the death of Emperor Gelawdewos in battle against Adal, and his brother Menas of disease. Menas' son, prince Yishaq was only 14 years old. He took the King name of Sarsa Dengel, and was crowned as Malik Sagad, meaning ''To whom the Muslims bow''. He would make good his title, as soon he revealed himself as an extraordinary military leader. He destroyed once and for all the power of Adal in 1576, contributing to its final demise. In a series of campaigns, he completely broke the power of the non-Talmudic Jewish Falashas, turning them into a silent minority. He defeated the Kingdom of Kefa, forcing his King to accept Christianity as the official religion, although the population did not convert. And he twice defeated the Turks, in 1578 and 1589, keeping them confined to the port of Massawa. Unfortunately he died before his time, after eating fish from a river ha had been warned by monks not to eat. Since his sons were too young, he had named his nephew Za Dengel as his heir. But the empress, his wife, had a different idea.

<h3>Description</h3>
When Sarsa Dengel died, his nephew Za Dengel was supposed to inherit the crown, but the Empress widow, with the support of some nobles crowned the young son of Sarsa Dengel, Yaqob, as Malik Sagad II, capturing Za Dengel. But Za Dengel with the help of the powerful Ras (Duke) Za Selassie, and his cousin Susenyos, was capable of seizing the crown in 1603. Then Pedro Pбez arrived to Ethiopia. He was a Spanish Jesuit from Madrid, who had studied at Coimbra, and had been sent to Ethiopia during the union of the crowns of Portugal and Spain. He soon learned not only Amharic, the court language, but also Ge'ez, the Ethiopian church language. He was an amazing man, and brought with him an Indian architect that revolutionized construction techniques in Ethiopia. Pбez built several churches in Ethiopia, and the local architects learned their techniques. Those techniques would be later used in the castles of Gonder. Impressed by the many talents of Pбez, and his prudence, Za Dengel named him his counselor.

<h3>Description</h3>
Influenced by Pedro Pбez, Za Dengel decided to convert to Catholicism. Pбez told him to be careful and not announce it, but Za Dengel boldly decided to introduce changes in the Sabbath. Pбez prudently decided to retire to the Jesuit base at Fremona, anticipating troubles. But in turning Catholic, Za Dengel gained powerful enemies. The Orthodox Church and his former supporter Ras Za Selassie took the side of former emperor Malik Sagad II Yaqob, and raised in arms. After defeating Za Dengel, Za Selassie had his eyes removed, his fingers cut, and then he had him trampled by horses to death. Yaqob was crowned again. However, Za Dengel's cousin and ally, Susenyos, continued the fight against his second cousin Yaqob.

<h3>Description</h3>
Susenyos refused to accept Yaqob as emperor, having been very close to his cousin Za Dengel. Susenyos had little chance against the nobility supporting Yaqob. However Susenyos was a resourceful military commander, and he enlisted the Oromo on his side. The Oromo had a very high military capability, and for the first time they were involved in the politics of their new country. From then on, the Oromo were a factor to be taken into consideration, becoming little by little the backbone of the Ethiopian army. Susenyos knew what he was doing. After defeating Ras Za Selassie, who took his side, he presented battle to the emperor Malik Sagad II Yaqob. During the battle Yaqob was killed, but his body was never found. To show the involvement of the Ethiopian Church in politics, the Abuna (Patriarch) Petros took command of Yaqob's army until he was also killed. Something that the Church would never forgive Susenyos. Emperor Susenyos was relatively removed from the main branch of the Solomonic Kings of Ethiopia, starting the so-called Gonder line. To tighten lose ends, he had one of Yaqob's sons strangled, and organized a military expedition against the Kingdom of Sennar (Nubia), where another son was rising an army, forcing him to exile to Rome. He also had two brothers of Yaqob beheaded. Susenyos also wrote several letters to Felipe III of Spain/Portugal asking for military help, but he never got it.

<h3>Description</h3>
Susenyos was mesmerized by Pedro Pбez too. He also took him as a counselor, and in one of their travels they reached the source of the Blue Nile in Lake Tana. Thus the Spaniard was the first European to see it and write about it, 150 years before Scottish James Bruce claimed the same feat. He was also the first European to describe the taste of coffee. Unfortunately his writings were not published until 1945. In his search of an alliance with Portugal, Susenyos finally decided to convert into Catholicism. Pedro Pбez became the head of the official Catholic Church of Ethiopia, and while he was alive, he avoided confrontation with the Orthodox Church and the unconvinced subjects.

</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
The Jesuit order sent Alfonzo Mendez in 1624 to substitute Pedro Pбez. He had himself invested as Abuna or Patriarch of the Ethiopian Catholic and Orthodox Church two years later. He then insisted in the observance of Catholic principles, even suppressing the traditional Orthodox calendar instating instead the Gregorian Roman calendar. The outrage was generalized, and soon rebellions against Susenyos started.

<h3>Description</h3>
Susenyos was successful at putting down rebellions, but became disheartened from having to kill good subjects that did not challenge the negus but the religious change. He therefore decided to proclaim religious freedom, effectively returning to Orthodoxy, and stepped down, leaving his son Fasilides to rule Ethiopia.

With a system that allowed princes to compete for the crown, internal strife was every generation's bread and butter in Ethiopia. When Fasilides own son Dewitt rose in rebellion against him, the emperor, instead of killing him, revived the old custom of confining posible claimants on the top of a mountain. For over a hundred years many princes spent their lives in Mount Wehni with the lucky ones being brought out to reign.

His most lasting achievement was the church of Debra Berham Selassie, the Light of Trinity, still in use.

<h3>Description</h3>
During his reign, Iyasu called a conference to revise the tax system on salt brought from Tigray. Caravan connections to Gondar were maintained with Massawa via Adwa, with Sudan, and through Gojjam to the southwest. Salt bars, called amole, had served as currency throughout Ethiopia for many centuries and some are reported to have found their way even to central Africa. They were packed in wood shavings to protect them. All the salt was cut from the vast surface deposits in the northern Danakil desert and carried by camel across highland Tigray. Amole became standardized by size and weight. Their value varied primarily according to the distance required to transport them. Until the mid-20th century, amole served as a currency almost throughout Black Africa.

<h3>Description</h3>
Saddened by the death of his favourite concubine, Iyasu retired to a monastery in an island of the Tana lake, without renouncing the crown. His absence was used by his wife Malakatawit to crown his son, Tekle Haymanot, as emperor Leul Sagad. When Iyasu emerged from his retirement, the awkward situation was solved by Tekle Haymanot ordering the murder of his own father. The outrage for the killing of such beloved monarch was great, and his son was labelled as cursed. The involvement of the empress and his acceptance by other members of the family, irreparably damaged the image of the Solomonic dynasty.

<h3>Description</h3>
Tekle Haymanot, the accursed, was quickly killed by some of his father's courtiers. Ras Bejirond (Chief treasurer) Yostos quickly seized power from the ailing Solomonic dynasty. He deposed 4 year old Tekle Haymanot's son Na'od, and brought Tewoflos from his confinement at Mount Wehni. Tewoflos, another son of Iyasus, ordered the execution of his step-mother Malakotawit and three of her relatives for the killing of his father. However he also had to face rebellions. When Tewoflos proved to be too independent, Ras Bejirond Yostos had him poisoned, seizing the crown for himself, despite not being a member of the royal family.

<h3>Description</h3>
Empress Mentewab had married his son Iyasu to an Oromo princess from Wollo, whose name was Wobit. She was baptized as Walatta Bersebeh before her marriage. When she tried to exert her share of power, she was ostracized by Mentewab. In vengeance, she raised his son as an Oromo. When Iyasu died, his son Iyoas was crowned emperor. To everybody's horror, Iyoas was only fluent in Oromo, and could barely speak Amharic. Soon a power struggle eructed between Mentewab party, and the Oromo relatives of Wobit. The emperor supported his mother against his grandmother, and appointed several of his Oromo uncles as generals.

<h3>Description</h3>
A noble of Tigray with some Solomonic blood, Mikael Sehul (the Astute), started his career by gaining control of the fortified city of Adwa. Located in the route between Gonder and Massawa, its possession gave him control of the main trade route in Ethiopia. By imposing taxes on trade, Mikael Sehul raised armies equipped with modern muskets. In 1759 he was made Ras of Tigray after getting rid of the previous one. He also married a daughter of Empress Mentewab, gaining the support of her powerful party. When the confrontation between Mentewab and her daughter-in-law Wobit, was about to start a civil war, he was called by the first to Gonder. He arrived with an army of 26,000 men, and displaced both parties, creating his own, based on the Amharic Christian nobility. He soon started squashing rebellions and defeating other parties, becoming the most powerful man in Ethiopia. He was recognized as such and the emperor was forced to invest him as Ras Bitwodad and Enderease (Viceroy) in 1768. However, emperor Iyoas resented his increasing power and the fall of his Oromo supporters.

<h3>Description</h3>
Emperor Iyoas tried to get rid of Mikael Sehul, but the plan backfired when Mikael defeated Oromo general Farsil. Mikael Sehul brought the matter to the Council and, for the first time in Ethiopian history, had the emperor deposed. Not happy with the solution of the Council, that considered the emperor untouchable, he had Iyoas strangled and his body abandoned to the elements. He then crowned a severely handicapped son of Iyasu that he rescued from Mount Wehni, Yohannes II. When four months later he refused to obey his orders, he had him poisoned, crowning next a 15 year-old boy, Tekle Haymanot, whom he kept as a captive. After that ordeal, nobody in the country could continue looking to the Solomonic dynasty as divine. People refused to pay taxes, warlords attempted to have their puppet crowned, peripheral regions refused to acknowledge any authority... The country plunged into the Zemene Mesafint, the Era of the Princes, when emperors changed with the seasons. It would last only until 1855.

<h3>Description</h3>
After a rebellion that saw Mikael Sehul expelled from Gonder, dissensions within the rebel party between Oromos and Amharans, allowed him to regain his capital. His vengeance was terrible. He first slaughtered a troop of travelling actors that had performed a satire of him. He then relentless pursued anyone who had supported the rebels and executed them. Dozens were killed, including the Abuna (Patriarch of the Ethiopian Church). Their bodies were hewn to pieces and scattered through the streets, where they served as a feast for the hyenas, that entered the city at night attracted by the stench. Scottish explorer James Bruce wrote an eye-witness account of these events. Finally the rebels reached an agreement, and were able to defeat and capture Mikael Sehul, forcing him to retire and leave way to a new puppet-master.

<h3>Description</h3>
By 1567, the sultanate of Adal had been reduced to the city of Harar and the Oromo had cut her vital connection to the ports of Saylac and Barbera. What had been Adal disintegrated, part falling under control of Somalies, and most becoming Oromo lands. The Ottomans took control of the Red Sea ports as payment for their help. In 1575, Emir Muhammad IV made the mistake of joining the rebellion of the governor of a Muslim province in the North East of Ethiopia. He was captured and executed by Emperor Sarsa Dengel, and this defeat saw the end of Adal's last army. In 1577, the emir transferred the sultanate of Adal to the Aussa oasis in the Danakil depression. This desert below sea-level was located in no-mans land between the Afars, the Ottomans at Massawa and the Ethiopians. By moving to one of the nastiest places in Africa the sultanate prolonged its nominal existence until it was overrun by Afars and Oromo in 1672. The city of Harar, remained viable behind its walls, independent from the sultanate since 1647, as a city-state. It always has been Muslim, and today is considered the fourth sacred city of Islam. For all practical purposes, 1577 saw the end of Adal as a state. The Ethiopians probably didn't notice it. Due to the Oromo they had lost control over most of the South, that was self-ruled by petty Kingdoms.
