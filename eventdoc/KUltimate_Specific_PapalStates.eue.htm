<h3>Description</h3>
The Council held in Constance from 1414 to 1418 brought an end to the Great Schism, declared its superiority over the Papacy, deposed two of the claimant popes (Gregorius XII elected in Rome and supported by Bayern, Naples, Hungary and Venice and Benedictus XIII elected in Avignon and supported by Castile, Aragon and Scotland) and pressed to abdicate the third (Johannes XXIII elected in the council of Pisa) and eventually chose a new pontiff, Martinus V. The new elected Pope left Constance at the close of the Council in May 1418 and travelled slowly through Italy, lingered at Florence and did not venture to enter Rome until September 1420. In fact, anarchy reigned in the Church held territories as no real government was ever established in there since 1309 when the Pope was first 'taken captive' in Avignon. Ladislao of Anjou-Durazzo, former King of Naples and vassal to the Pope, had occupied Rome and the whole Patrimonium Petri, whilst Braccio da Montone, former commander of Papal troops, was destabilizing the State of the Church from inside by looting villages and trying to establish his own Signoria in Umbria. Turmoil was everywhere...

<h3>Description</h3>
The Council held in Constance deposed the three claimant Popes and elected a new one, Martinus V. Amongst them, Gregorius XII humbly accepted the decision of the council and retired but he died soon after, Benedictus XIII refused to retire but fled to Peсiscola in Aragon while Johannes XXIII, who convoked the council believing to be confirmed, deeply resented by what was decreed tried to invalidate the council but failed and after a dubious process he was sentenced to life imprisonment. After his election, Martinus V made his way to Rome and travelling slowly through Italy he was hosted in Turin, Milan, Brescia, Mantova, Ferrara and after avoiding the rebel city Bologna he reached Florence where he was welcomed. Fearing for an escape of Johannes XXIII, who although imprisoned in Bayern had still some followers there, Martinus V arranged for him to be moved to a nearer prison in Italy. During the trip, Johannes XXIII however managed to escape, but after a short stay in Liguria he went to Florence, recognized Martinus V as legitimate Pope and changed the name back with his own, Baldassarre Cossa. The last Pope of Pisa died in Florence 7 months later.

<h3>Description</h3>
Entering his dominions, the Pope's first task was to restore the State of the Church to the prosperity and order to which it had become a stranger. In doing this he tried to gain external political support which he eventually obtained from Giovanna II of the House of Anjou-Durazzo and Queen of Naples, also known as Giovannetta or the 'Queen-Bee' for her dissolute life. In exchange for the repossession of the Papal territories, which her brother Ladislao formerly occupied when Rome had no ruler, Giovanna was legitimately enthroned Queen of Naples by the Pope in a solemn ceremony held in the city of Naples on 28 October 1419. But the Pope desperately needed troops to bring back the order over the territories of the Papal Legations in Umbria, Marche and Romagna, where the populations rebelled thanks to the abuses perpetrated by Braccio da Montone's mercenaries, and asked Giovanna II for help.

<h3>Description</h3>
The series of Jubilees celibrated in Rome by the Catholic Church was not initiated by the Pope or the Roman Curia, but by 'the people'. On Christmas night of 1299 Pilgrims and the citizens of Rome gathered in St Peter's Basilica, they were convinced that the church ought to grant something special at the beginning of 1300. Pope Boniface VIII proclaimed a Holy Year, which involved pilgrimages to the Basilicas of St Peter and St Paul and the granting of indulgences. The Jubilee of 1423 was proclaimed by Martin V to celebrate the end of the Schism when the Anit-Popes John XXIII and Benedict XIII were deposed by the council of Constance. The basilica of St John Lateran was opened for the first time.

<h3>Description</h3>
In January of 1429 Assembly of East and Central European leaders was held in Lutsk. Emperor Sigismund, as well as the Polish King Jagiello and Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas were the major participants. During the meeting the Emperor offered a crown of independent Kingdom of Lithuania to Vitautas. Jagiello apparently agreed, but after the uproar in the Polish camp, he quickly rescinded his agreement and hastily left the meeting together with Polish nobles. Soon after, Jagiello offered Polish crown to Vytautas citing poor health and inability to rule, which Emperor Sigismund agreed to. However, the Pope, recognizing a danger of recently converted Lithuanian lands being lost to Orthodoxy, forbade the sending of the crown, and Polish nobles led by Zbigniew Olesnicki captured it on its way to Wilno.

<h3>Description</h3>
The claim to the Canary Islands was disputed for a very long time. Portugal argued that they were closer to their coasts, while Castile argued that they belonged to the diocese of Tingitania (Morocco) and were therefore part of the Visigothic Kingdom to which they were entitled, and both monarchs contested the decision of Pope Clement VI to give the islands to Luis de la Cerda, a Spanish nobleman, in 1344. But their hostile natives prevented any settlement, and nothing was done until French noblemen Jean de Bethencourt disembarks in Lanzarote in 1402. Being succesful in the conquest of the island, he travelled the next year to Castile, and obtained from Enrique III the concession for the conquest of the islands in his name. He managed to conquer another three islands. But the three bigger islands could not be conquered, as resistance from the natives, of pre-islamic Berber origen, was strong. With the African explorations of Don Henrique, the Canary islands constituted a convenient base, and Henrique sent two expeditions, in 1424 and 1427, that failed due to native resistance and lack of supplies. When Duarte became King in 1433, he activated his diplomacy, and was granted by Pope Eugenius IV, the right to Christianize the islands that remained pagan, given the success of Portugal against the North African Muslims.

<h3>Description</h3>
When Juan II of Castile found out that the Pope had given Duarte of Portugal the right to conquer some of the Canary islands, he sent his best ambassador, Alonso de Cartagena, to try to revert the decision. Curiously, the main argument used by Alonso was not that those islands were part of a group already half conquered by Castile, but that the right of Castile to the islands had the same basis that the right the monarchs of Castile had over their Kingdom, that they inherited from the Visigoth Kings, and these from the Roman Emperors. The argument must have been a good one, because Eugenius IV, knee deep in his problems with the Council of Basel, reversed his previous decision and published a bull in 1436 recognizing the rights of Castile to all the islands and exhorting Portugal to not enter a war with Castile over them. There would still be a couple of failed attempts at their conquest by the Portuguese in 1448 and 1455, but with the finding of better islands in the coast of Africa to act as bases, the interest for the Canary islands decayed. Meanwhile the Castilians were advancing all the time in their settlement, and finally between 1477 and 1496 the Catholic King's armies fully conquered the remaining islands.

<h3>Description</h3>
Convoked in 1431 and closed in 1449, the true issue of this Council was to determine if it was the Pope or periodically convoked Councils who would govern the Church. It did not go well. Whether it was the Pope's thirst of power or the radicalism of the conciliars theorists, no compromise was found. What should have been a great opportunity to reform the church and restore confidence just created more chaos. The last Antipope was elected in 1439 by the Council: Amadeus Duke of Savoy under the name of Felix V. He did not have a great success as an Antipope and submitted in 1449. The fate of the Catholic Church was sealed in the form of a monarchical hierarchy who would not be able to react to the new challenges to come.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Vinland Map is a 15th century map of the world. It is believed to have been commissioned circa 1440 to support the Council of Basel. Its captions tell of the Carpini mission carrying the Faith to Tartary in the Northeast, Bishop Eric Gnupsson visiting Vinland in the Northwest, Prester John established in the Southeast, and even Saint Brendan in the Antilles in the Southwest. The importance of the map is that it depicts a body of land across the Atlantic called Vinilanda Insula (Island of Vinland). In modern times the map was first found in 1957. Its current owner is Yale University. Two scientific conferences, in 1966 and 1996, were held to debate the map's authenticity, but no final determination could be made. If authentic it would be the oldest map of North America ever found.

<h3>Description</h3>
Corsica was once part the Donation of Pepin to the Papacy. Hard pressed by Muslims raiders, we had to grant it for defence to the Margraviate of Tuscany first, then to the sea-republics of Pisa and Genoa, finally to Aragon. Some of the local leaders are tired of all the strife caused by those multiple claims. They ask that we take charge again.

Proclaimed by Nicholas V, who brought back the Jubilee to the 50 year cycle. There was a great flow of pilgrims but in summer a plague claimed many victims. When it abated, the number of pilgrims increased again. Among them were St Rita of Cascia, St John Capistran, St Catherine of Bologna, King Ferdinand of Naples, Queen Carlotta of Cyprus, Blessed Angelico who painted some papal rooms for that occassion. The Vatican Library was founded on the offerings of the pilgrims. St Bernardine of Siena was canonised. The visits to the basilicas were reduced to 3 days.

<h3>Description</h3>
During the war of succession in Milan, all the belligerent nations were brought to exhaustion of money and troops. Francesco Sforza, ruler of Milan and Venice, the chief state of the league confederates, who was more and more threatened by the advancing Ottomans in her eastern Mediterranean territories, convened a cease-fire while a bilateral treaty was hastily signed in Lodi on 7 April 1454. With that treaty Sforza was legitimated Duke of Milan. Without even being called for, Florence and the Pope had no choice then to endorse the treaty. The King of Naples, being a rightful claimant on the ducal throne reluctantly joined the alliance under the condition to keep Genoa out of it. Intended 'infra terminos italicos', that treaty showed the objective impossibility for all the Italian major powers (specifically Milan, Tuscany, Venice, Naples and Papal States) to prevail upon each other in the struggle for the hegemony in Italy and that the better solution was to come to terms with each other. That would have also avoided the practice of very expensive and pointless wars in the next future. Although the treaty actually played a minor part in Italian balance of powers and so won't be able to avoid future wars of aggression from inside as well from outside Italy, the post-Lodi era historically represented a period of relative peace in which the figurative arts definitively flourished in the whole Italian peninsula, as well as economy and trade and, last but not the least, the skills and tricks of the art of diplomacy.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1455, Alfonso de Borya (Borgia to the Italians), Bishop of Valencia, assumed the throne of St. Peter as Callixtus III. As a Bishop, he had been instrumental in healing the great schism in the church by persuading the French anti-Pope, Clement VIII to submit to the authority of Martin V. Callixtus III was a compromise candidate between two rival factions, and soon after assuming power he elevated his nephew, Rodrigo Borgia, to a cardinal. Currently, there is a dramatic change in attitudes regarding Joan of Arc, the Maid of Orleans. There is a popular call to annul her sentence and absolve her of heresy.

<h3>Description</h3>
Callixtus III was soon known to be politically ruthless and greedy (survival traits in Italian politics). In an effort to organize a Crusade to liberate Constantinople from the Turks, he resorted to selling indulgences, cardinalates, annulments, grants of papal terretory, works of art, and even valuable books. These methods, together with the imposition of heavy taxes made him unpopular both at home and abroad. It was apparent that enthusiasm for participation in a Crusade was not high among the Christian Princes of Europe.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1459 Pope Pius II called the Congress of Mantua to organise a crusade against the Turk, but only a few delegates showed up. By 1461 the crusade had made no progress so Pius asked Mehmed II to convert. Since that didn't work either, he decided to lead the crusade himself despite being ill. France was at odds with the Pope, Burgundy delayed their help, Milan was trying to seize Genoa, and Florence cynically advised the Pope to let the Turks and the Venetians wear each other out. But the Venetians and the Hungarians signed their support in 1463. Thousands of destitute men from all of Europe came to the Pope's call and he led them to Ancona in the summer of 1464, where he became very ill. While waiting for the Venetian fleet, plague broke out and the crusade army melted away. On August 14, when the Venetians finally arrived, the Pope expired. Doge Christoforo Moro seeing no army and no fleet but his 12 galleys, took the 40,000 ducats collected to pay the Hungarians from the cardinals and returned home.

<h3>Description</h3>
Alum was a salt essential for dyes. Until 1460, nearly all European supplies of the mineral came from Asia minor near Smyrna (modern Izmir). In 1455 control of the trade passed from the Genoese to the Ottomans. In 1460, immense deposits were found in Tolfa, a town near Civitavecchia in Lazio. In 1466, the Pope signed an agreement with a consortium led by his primary bankers, the Medici, to mine and export the alum. At this time the Medici were the predominant family in Florence, and Piero de' Medici controlled Tuscan policy.

<h3>Description</h3>
The more moderate wing of the heretic Hussites of Bohemia had been granted limited religious freedom in 1436 by the Compactates and since then practiced its faith openly in Bohemia, tolerated by the Catholic church. When Pius II rose to the Holy See, he was determined to end this situation. He got George of Podiebrad who was a Hussite himself to promise converting to Catholicism and suppressing all heresy in Bohemia just before his election in 1458. Podiebrad however, while indeed planning to return to the Roman Church himself, had no intention to persecute his former coreligionists and insisted on the Compactates. As a reaction, on March 31st 1462 Pius declared that the Compactates had been valid only for the generation that lived back then and were now invalid and demanded Bohemia's full return to Catholicism. At an assembly of the estates in Prague, George refused and said he would to his death remain true to the communion of both kinds, and that he was ready to risk his life and his crown in defense of his faith. Pius then quickly terminated negotiations with Bohemia and declared George a heretic in 1464. Encouraged by the church, the Catholic nobles of Bohemia began a revolt against Podiebrad in 1465. The King of Bohemia was officially excommunicated and his subjects released from their oaths on December 23rd 1466. Afterwards, the - theoretically now vacant - Bohemian throne was offered first to Friedrich of Brandenburg and, when he refused, to Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. The King of Hungary accepted and began a campaign against Bohemia.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1471, Sixtus IV abandoned universal interests, concentrating on Italian politics and revealing his confirmed nepotism. His beneficiaries were members of his own family, whom he greatly enriched and who involved him in messy disputes, the worst of which was a conspiracy against Lorenzo de' Medici. Other disputes where against the Este family in failing to provide the annual tribute for usage of Papal lands in the Romagna. To gain these lands from the Este family for his own family, Sixtus IV committed himself rather scandalously to Venice's aim in destroying the Kingdom of Ferrara, which he incited the Venetians to attack in 1482. Venice refusing to desist from the hostilities that Sixtus had instigated and for appearing to be a dangerous rival to the Papal States after taking all of the polesine, was placed under interdict in 1483.

<h3>Description</h3>
Proclaimed by Sixtus IV who brought back the Jubilee to a 25 year cycle. In the Bull of Proclamation, the Jubilee was called for the first time 'Holy Year'. All other indulgences were suspended for this occassion. For the first time the Papal Bull was printed, a system which Guttenburg created in 1469 by inventing the movable type. The Pope had frescoes painted on the walls of the Sistine Chapel by Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Cosimo Rosselli and Pietro Perugino. The Tibur overflowed its banks and the basilica of St Paul could be reached only by boat.

<h3>Description</h3>
In the 1470's Papal power expanded into many towns that were on the Tuscan border, causing much concern in Florence. Lorenzo de' Medici, who ran Florence, stopped serving as the Popes banker, and allowed the Popes opponents to raise troops in Tuscany. Florence then refused to accept the papal nominee as archbishop, and organized an alliance between the major powers of Northern Italy - Milan Venice and Florence, that threatened the expansion of papal authority. In early 1477 the Pope met with members of the Pazzi family, who proposed to overthrow and replace Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence. They told the Pope that they would have to kill the Medici, and he did not oppose their plan. In April 1478 at high mass in the cathedral of Florence the conspirators attacked Giuliano and Lorenzo de' Medici as the host was elevated. Giuliano was killed by a mercenary, but the two priests assigned to kill Lorenzo only wounded him in the neck. What should we do about the proposal to kill the Medici?

<h3>Description</h3>
The second Borgia Pope, Rodrigo, was the nephew of Callixtus III, and assumed the Pontificate under the name of Alexander VI. He had employed bribery to purchase votes, a practice known as simony, and not uncommon at the time. Alexander VI was famed for his pursuit of gold and women. He had fathered seven children, one of whom, the condottiere Cesare, was elevated to the status of Captian-General of the Papal armies, while another son, Jofre, was married into the Aragonese royal family. Alexander was a ruthless, yet gifted ruler whose goal was the complete subjugation of the Papal state by whatever means necessary, including murder. The power of the Papacy hitherto has been restrained by two Roman baronial factions, the Orsini and Colonna. How shall we approach this problem?

<h3>Description</h3>
The second Borgia Pope, Rodrigo, was the nephew of Callixtus III, and assumed the Pontificate under the name of Alexander VI. He had employed bribery to purchase votes, a practice known as simony, and not uncommon at the time. Alexander VI was famed for his pursuit of gold and women. He had fathered seven children, one of whom, the condottiere Cesare, was elevated to the status of Captian-General of the Papal armies, while another son, Jofre, was married into the Aragonese royal family. Alexander was a ruthless, yet gifted ruler whose goal was the complete subjugation of the Papal state by whatever means necessary, including murder. The power of the Papacy hitherto has been restrained by two Roman baronial factions, the Orsini and Colonna. How shall we approach this problem?

<h3>Description</h3>
Lucrezia was the daughter of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia and his mistress, Vannozza de Cattanei. The name Lucrezia Borgia conjures visions of a beautiful, heartless, rapacious, carnal, treacherous femme fatale, who easily discarded husbands and lovers, and delighted in poisonings, stabbings, and garrottings along with her evil brother Cesare. While possibly the victim of anti-Borgia propaganda, it is certain the she was a gifted administrator who ably assisted the government of Alexander, her father, as well that of her various husbands. Later in life, she was known as an able administrator and charitable patron of the arts and the poor. To whom shall we betroth our lovely Daughter of Christ?

<h3>Description</h3>
The presence of Charles VIII of France in the Kingdom of Naples scared the Italian princes, who had in a certain way permitted the French King to achieve his goal of settling there almost undisturbed. Venice and Florence were worried about a French hegemony in the peninsula. French military presence wasn't limited to Southern Italy but also to villages of Tuscany and the Papal States, which previously surrendered to Charles VIII in his march towards Naples, strategically located to grant the French military supply line. The Pope, who previously granted the French King military access through the Papal territories and consented his stay in Rome, felt in jeopardy as much as to refuse Charles VIII being proclaimed King of Naples. Also King Ferdinand of Aragon couldn't accept the French presence in a Kingdom where he instead, in spite of Alfons V's testament which assigned Naples to the other Trastamara branch, could be the one to have claims there. The position of Naples was also important for the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean. The Duke of Milan, who decisively affected Charles VIII's decision to settle in Naples, was now alarmed by the presence of French reserve troops deployed in the county of Asti, very close to Milan and at the order of the Duke of Orlйans, who had dynastical claims to the Milanese throne. So Venice, Milan, the Pope, Spain and even the Holy Roman Empire (so firmly opposed to the French expansionism in Italy as to join any Anti-French alliance available) consequently formed the Anti-French league in Venice on 31 March 1495. Florence preferred to stay out because of her internal problems caused by Charles VIII's passage and decided to support France instead. Having heard about those arrangements and fearing that the confederates would isolate his army in Italy, Charles VIII decided to return to France for reinforcements leaving his regent in Naples. He had to move his army quickly through the Apennines as to reach the Alps and then safety, but the presence of heavy artilleries and carriages transporting the big loot he accumulated across Italy, slowed his march down. Only at Fornovo on the Taro River, in the Po Valley, Charles VIII finally faced the army of the confederates. Despite having lost all the carriages, he managed to reach the Alps gaining from his expedition to Italy nothing but his army decimated by epidemies.

Proclaimed by Alexander VI. The Jubilee was celebrated with great pomp the blowing of trumpets. In the Bull of Proclamation, the Pope indicated (as Boniface VIII had already done) that all Romans had to make 30 visits to the 4 basilicas and foreigners 15 visits as necessary for obtaining the indulgence. The penitentiaries of St Peter had the faculties to reduce the visits to 7 and 5 respectively. Participating in the Jubilee was Nicholas Copernicus. 1500 also marked a year of war for the Papacy. Alexander VI's son, Cesare Borgia, syled the Duke of Valentino, is bent on consolidating his power within the Papal domains, but is opposed by powerful families led by the Colonesi.

<h3>Description</h3>
In August 1503, Alexander VI and his son both fell ill. Alexander and Cesare had dined with Cardinal Adrian Corneto at the latter's villa. It had long been believed that the Borgia intended to make Corneto their next victim. Corneto swithed a cup with the Borgias that he believed had been poisoned. Cesare recovered from his illness, while Alexander died at 77. Alexander was succeded briefly by Pius III. Pius quicky died, then the bitter enemy of the Borgias, Giulano della Rovere ascended the throne of St. Peter as Julius II. Julius was first and foremost a warrior who personally led the Papal armies. Paradoxically, he completed the work of the Borgias by bringing Papal territories firmly under the influence of Rome. He was in addition a patron of the arts (Raphael, Michaelangelo, and Bramante enjoyed his patronage). Julius also made efforts to suppress the corruption, simony, and nepotism which had run rampant in Rome.

<h3>Description</h3>
As soon as Louis XII conquered Milan, he respected the pacts with Alexander VI and helped Cesare Borgia to carve himself a principality in Romagna and Marche. In November 1499 Cesare Borgia, also known as 'il Valentino' because of his ducal title, started his adventure in Romagna and Marche, territories belonging to the Papal States only nominally where the fiefs of Rimini, Pesaro, Imola, Faenza, Forli, Urbino and Camerino were declared forfeited with Papal bulls for the reason that they didn't pay the census to the Church. Imola and Faenza were his first conquests then he took Cesena but he had to suspend the military operations because of il Moro's restauration in Milan. He used the ceasefire to pay a visit in Rome for the Holy Year and to be appointed Gonfaloniere of the Church by his father. By the end of the year, Borgia resumed his military campaign and the following year, with the conquests of Pesaro, Rimini and Faenza, took control of Romagna, for which he obtained the ducal investiture by Pope Alexander VI. Cesare Borgia's greed wasn't yet satisfied, he also wanted to submit the cities of Bologna and Firenze, but since those cities asked Louis XII's military protection, he diverted to Marche principalities where he managed to easily submit the duchies of Urbino and Camerino. But in August 1503, both Cesare and Alexander fell very ill simultaneously, wether from an epidemy or poison it is unclear. Alexander died, and two days later the Orsini family rose against Cesare in Rome. Venice saw the opportunity to send troops to reinstate the petty tyrants in Romagna under condition that they should accept her suzerainity. They took direct control of Faenza, since the Manfredi were extinct, and of Rimini, which Malatesta surrendered to Venice. When Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, a sworn enemy of the Borgias, was elected Pope with the name of Julius II, with the Venetian cardinals's support because he was favorable in principle to the Venetian interests, he saw that what Cesare Borgia had been doing was what was needed to bring the Papal States under effective control. But despite the arrangement with Cesare that gained his support in the Papal election, il Valentino was an obstacle, so breaking his word, Julius II got rid of him having the King of Aragon order his imprisonment in Spain. Cesare would escape two years later only to die helping his brother-in-law the King of Navarre quell a rebellion in 1507.

<h3>Description</h3>
Venice, shorn suddenly of her commercial hegemony, bereft of friends or allies, under continual and increasing threat from the Turks in the East and the princes of Europe in the West, it seemed to her that her only long-term hope of survival lay in building up a broad mainland bulwark. Thus, when the dispossessed lords of cities that had fallen to Cesare Borgia sought refuge in Venetian territory, she had immediately offered them sympathy and shelter. And when, seeing Cesare facing a crisis in his fortunes, these nobles made determined and more or less simultaneous bids to reinstate themselves, she gave them her active support - always provided that they would accept her as their overlord and govern in her name. By the end of 1503 the banner of St Mark was already floating over Russi and Forlimpopoli, Rimini, Cervia, and Faenza. - John Norwich, A History of Venice, New York, 1989. Taking possession of Rimini, Faenza, and a number of other cities, Venice strengthened her position below the Po River where the city of Ravenna worked as strategic outpost since 1431. But Julius II, having secured his own control of the Papal armies by arresting and imprisoning il Valentino, quickly moved to re-establish Papal control over the Romagna (since it was amongst the territories ceded to the Holy See by Pepin III in 752 in what constituted the original Papal States) by demanding that Venice return the cities she had seized. Venice refused to surrender the cities, although willing to acknowledge Papal sovereignty over them and pay an annual tribute to the Holy See. After having unsuccessfully induced Venice to abandon Romagna by means of a Papal bull, the resolute Julius II began to look for allies. Only in September 1504 at Blois where Louis XII of France stipulated a treaty with which he renounced his claims over Naples in favour of Spain for the investiture of the Duchy of Milan, at the presence of the Emperor and the Archduke of Burgundy Philippe le Beau, the Pope let them include a secret paragraph by which the signatories would have allied against Venice. In facts Julius II did not possess sufficient forces to fight Venice even if for the next two years he recovered a few small towns in Romagna and managed to bring under Papal rule, Bologna and Perugia, both only nominally subject to the church and also to re-establish the order in Rome by means of political marriages between his family, the Della Rovere, and the rival factions of Colonna and Orsini.

<h3>Description</h3>
When, at the end of the 15th century, with Charles VIII the Italian Wars began, the Swiss were described by the Italian historian Guicciardini, as 'the nerve and the hope of an army'. In 1495 the life of the King of France was saved thanks to the immovable firmness of his Swiss foot-soldiers. At the beginning of the 16th century the Vatican began to employ Swiss mercenaries, who had a reputation of courage, noble sentiments and loyalty. Because of their faithful and disinterested service Pope Julius II in 1505 asked the Swiss Federal Tagesatzung to provide him with a constant core of 200 Swiss mercenaries for the protection of the Apostolic palace in Rome. In September 1505, a first contingent of 150 soldiers started their march towards Rome, they entered for the first time the Vatican in the evening of the 22nd of January 1506, where they were blessed by Pope Julius II. The prelate Johann Burchard of Strasbourg, Master of Pontifical Ceremonies at that time, and author of a famous chronicle, noted that event in his diary. Their first, and most significant, hostile engagement was on May 6, 1527 when 147 Guards, including their commander, died fighting the lansquenets lead by Charles de Bourbon, Constable of France, in the Sack of Rome.

<h3>Description</h3>
Since 1495, Venice had been holding the main ports of Apulia despite Aragonese claims to have them back. With the French invasion of Milan, Venice had acquired Milanese territories east of the Adda River, and upon the fall of Cesare Borgia had also acquired Rimini, Faenza and Ravenna, against the will of Pope Julius II. The Venetians also held Veneto and Friuli, on which Maximilian of Habsburg had imperial claims. In late 1507 Maximilian announced his intention to travel to Italy to receive the imperial investiture from the Pope himself, and in early 1508 he assembled a big army to escort him down to Rome. He requested free passage through Venetian territories, but was told that he would be allowed passage only without his army. Enraged at the answer, Maximilian attacked Venice, but this decision proved unwise: Venice not only routed the imperial army but also seized the imperial cities of Trieste, Gorz and Fiume. A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure, forcing Maximilian to conclude a humiliating three-year truce. With Pope Julius II's assent, Maximilian took the title of 'Emperor-elect', thus breaking the century-old custom that the Holy Roman Emperor had to be crowned by the Pope. Shortly afterward, Venice provided a pretext for war by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza. The Emperor, the King of France and Ferdinand of Aragon gathered in Cambrai in December 1508 to sign a treaty which seemed to be a defensive alliance against the Turk. In reality they meant to form a league to attack Venice and deprive the Serenissima of most of her mainland territories. Pope Julius II, after a renewed Venetian refusal to give the Romagna lands back to the Papacy, ratified the treaty and at the same time proceeded to excommunicate all Venetian citizens. Ferrara and Mantua, each with separate claims to territories held by Venice, joined the league as well. In April 1509 military operations started, and a month later French troops decimated one of the two Venetian armies at the battle of Agnadello. Even though in August 1509 Venice managed to eliminate Mantua from the war, she still faced the collapse of her strategic position and had by February 24, 1510 to accept the papal demands on the cities she had occupied in Romagna. However, Pope Julius II was still not satisfied and demanded that the war be prosecuted until Venice conceded control over their church to the Pope and compensated him for his expenses. The Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity. This opportunity presented itself shortly afterward.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Renaissance saw the recovery of the classical culture of the greek and roman antiquity. It was mostly a Italian phenomenon, but the center of the catholic church was Italian itself. The popes were promoting the arts and the letters. However, it could be said that they were also promoting luxury and immorality. When the German and very devout Luther visited Rome, he was striken by that kind of unChristian spirit. In fact, corruption, venality, nepotism and intrigues undermined the credibility of the Holy See in Europe throughout the Renaissance. It was certainly one of the indirect causes of the Reformation.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1510 Venice submitted to the Pope, thus lessening the league of Cambrai. Conditions were hard for Venice, the Republic had to renounce her traditional power to appoint bishops as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venetian territory and was to compensate Pope Julius II for his war expenses needed to recapture the Papal holdings in Romagna, while the Pope accepted the humble request of the Republic for pardon, cancelling the interdict. But the reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French to continue the war against Venice with attacks to her cities in Terraferma. Julius II, in the meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy and formulated plans, both to chase the French out of the Po Valley and to seize the Duchy of Ferrara, a French ally, with the intention to add the territories of Modena, Reggio and Ferrara to the Papal States. In realizing his plan the Pope immediately excommunicated Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, declaring his fief forfeited for his remaining loyal to France, then he gained the military support of Venice, eager to recover her territories lost to the French a armies and hired an army of Swiss mercenaries to attack Milan as to isolate the French armies in Italy. However his plans failed as the French army managed to invade Romagna and occupy the cities of Bologna and Ravenna, supported by the powerful and celebrated artillery of Duke Alfonso d'Este. In addition, in response to Pope's switching sides, Louis XII of France convoked a Schismatic Council at Pisa as to have the 'Warrior Pope' deposed. Pope Julius II, having unsuccessfully pressed the Republic of Florence to refuse hosting the schismatic cardinals, proclaimed the Holy League against France and convoked a Council of his own to meet at the Lateran in Rome. The promise of territorial gains at French expense caused Ferdinand II of Aragon and Emperor Maximilian I to abandon their alliance with the French, and in October 1511, they joined the newly-formed Holy League together with Julius II and the Republic of Venice. In November, Henry VIII of England and the Swiss confederation joined as well.

<h3>Description</h3>
Born in Andalusia, El Hasan ben Muhammed el-Wazzan-ez-Zayyati was expelled from Spain in 1492 and, along with thousands of other Moors, settled in Fez. As a youth he accompanied his uncle on trips throughout North Africa and down the Sudan, travelling to lands south of the burning Sahara, including the fabled city of Timbuktu. In 1518 the ship he was on was captured by Pedro Bodiviglia, a Knight of Saint John, and Hasan was taken to Rome as a prisoner. Pope Leo X was fascinated with the learned Muslim and freed him, after which Hasan converted to Christianity and took the name Giovanni Leone, or Leo Africanus (Leo the African). The Pope even gave him a good income just to study Italian so he could write down his exploits in a book. Leo took him up on the offer, writing History and Description of Africa and the Notable Things Contained Therein, published in 1526. Later in life, Hasan resettled in Tunis and converted back to Islam, but his book gave Europeans a rare glimpse of the rich lands to the south.

<h3>Description</h3>
The condemnation of the ideas of Luther was not a hasty decision. His Ninety-five Theses had been made known the 31 october of 1517 and judged some weeks later as heretical by German theologians. It became a very public controversy. One year later, Luther had the support of many German princes and Rome began to worry. All these ideas of reform were becoming more and more radical. Luther got as far as to appeal the Emperor to destroy the power of the Pope. The 15 july of 1520, after careful scrutiny of his writings, Rome formally condemned forty-one propositions of Luther and summoned him to recant. It did no good, of course, but at the time there was already no space for a compromise. If the Pope had tried for such a compromise, it would have mean more trouble in Italy than peace in Germany.

<h3>Description</h3>
Celebrated by Clemens VII (1523-1534). The crisis of the medieval Jubilee began in 1525 after the Theses of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation, when doubts rose about the opportunity whether or not to celebrate the Holy Year. In facts the Lutherans spread out several booklets in which they openly accused Pope Clemens VII to proclaim the Jubilee with the purpose to increase the Church's treasury only. However in April 1524 Clemens VII decided to promulgate the Jubilee with the papal bull 'Inter sollicitudes et coram nobis'. That papal bull exempted only the pilgrims in Rome from charity while anyone else, who couldn't reach the Eternal City, was still obliged to get indulgencies. For the first time the Holy Door of St Peter's was opened with a golden hammer. The Holy Year wasn't much participated due to the current Italian wars, to the fear for the advancing Turk and to the peasant's revolts in Germany. And more, in august 1525 there was a new outbreak of the plague while in May 1527, two years after that Jubilee, Rome was terribly 'sacked' by the imperial Lansquenets.

<h3>Description</h3>
The 14,000 lansquenets, hired by Charles V in the war against the League of Cognac under the command of Georg von Frundsberg, were animated by a violent spirit of crusade against the Pope (Frundsberg was bringing a golden rope with which he insanely meant to hang the Pope and his cardinals!) but also, and most of all, angry for lack of pay. Abandoned by their captains, they begun to plunder villages in search of loots. Soon they were joined by 6,000 Spanish soldiers lead by Charles, Connйtable de Bourbon, and by any sort of ruffians of any condition (mercenaries at the Emperor's service, diserting or disbanded troops of the League and common criminals), all of them with the common aim to make the way to Rome, the city of sin, and 'sack' it. On the morning of 6 May 1527, from his headquarters set up on the Gianicolo hill, Captain General Bourbon with his 40,000 soldiers launched a series of attacks on Rome. During one of them, at the Torrione Gate, while leading the assault of the walls, he himself was mortally wounded (Benvenuto Cellini, who took part in the defence of the walls, would boast about having shot the deadly bullet). Instead of being let down, the Spanish troops' confidence was boosted by their commander's sudden death and at the expenses of big losses, managed to break through the city walls and enter the Borgo while the imperial lansquenets broke rushed towards the Holy See. Pope Clement VII and his followers were able to escape into safety, thanks to the 'Passetto', a secret corridor which Pope Alexander VI had built along the top of the wall connecting the Vatican with Castel Sant'Angelo. Across the Sisto bridge the bewildered soldiers fell on the unarmed city and for eight days committed every sort of violence, theft, sacrilege and massacre. The streets were a mixture of drunken soldiers, corpses and heaps of every sort of luxury goods taken from churches, monasteries and palaces. No league army dared to enter the city to drive out the ravaging troops and rescue the Pope, who accepted to pay a huge ransom only six months later.

<h3>Description</h3>
On 2 November 1535 duke Francesco II died childless. At those times, the only dynasty having valid claims to legitimately rule over the duchy of Milan was the French House of Orlйans, which last member, Louis XII, also King of France, had previously bequeathed his Orlйanais inheritance to the husband of his daughter Claude, Franзois of the House of Valois-Angouleme, also known as Franзois Ier King of France. The claims to the duchy of Milan dated back to Bianca Visconti, King Louis XII's grandmother and sister of Filippo Maria Visconti, the last duke of Milan of his dynasty. Because of this inheritance, Franзois Ier and his sons could consider themselves as the only legitimate candidates to rule over the imperial duchy. Also Pope Paulus III of the Farnese family was aiming at the imperial administration over Milan and Parma to be assigned by the emperor to his illegitimate son Pier Luigi.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1540 Pope Paulus III recognized the Jesuite Order, created 1534 by the Spaniard Don Iсigo Lуpez de Recalade, better know as Ignatius of Loyola. He becomes one of the most devoted counter reformists and enemy #1 of the protestant movement. Loyola having a soldier background makes its mark on the order, which is organized almost as an army. High priority was given both to educating missionaries but also counselors for European royal courts. This made the Jesuite order very powerful in the politic scene. 1773 the Jesuite order was dissolved by Pope Pius VI due to pressure from Christian countries in the age of enlightenment. 1814 the Jesuite order was reinstituted, however just as a faint shadow of the powerful order it once had been.

<h3>Description</h3>
At the initiative of Pietro Caraffa from Naples, the Pope reorganizes the Roman inquisition according to the Spanish model. Together with the Jesuits a reign of terror is inflicted on the people. However the cruel methods are effective and lead to completely eradicating the protestant movement in the Italian peninsula.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Counterreformation movement historically started 1540 with the institution of the Societas Jesu. This marked the beginning of a few highly volatile decades in European history while the two sides of Reformed and Counter reformed fight each other. At the same time there were forces within the Catholic Church wanting a reform to remedy the corruption and other bad conditions present. Thus 1545 the Council of Trient is opened. The debating went on for almost 20 years with almost as much turmoil created as on the battlefields against the Protestants.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1545 Pope Paul III invested his illegitimate son Pier Luigi with the lands south of the Po River that were formerly part of the Duchy of Milan. Centred on the city of Parma, Pier Luigi's heir Ottavio would acquire Piacenza establishing the Farnese as Dukes of Parma and Piacenza. His descendents continued to rule until their extinction in 1731, whereby it passed through the Heiress Elizabeth Farnese to the Spanish Bourbons.

Proclaimed by Paul III (Alessandro Farnese) who died on Nov 10th 1549. The Jubilee was celebrated by Julius III (it was also a Jubilee of 2 Popes just like in 1390). Among the participants were Francis Borgia, the Armenian Patriarch Stephen, Michelangelo Bonarroti, Giorgio Vasari, St Ignatius of Loyola, St Philip Neri who welcomed poor pilgrims to the Archconfraternity of the Most Holy Trinity where meals were offered to 800 pilgrims everyday. Pope Julius III ordered the reopening of the Council of Trient for the 1st May 1551 after the interruption of the first sessions 1545-1549. Newly interrupted in 1552, the Council of Trient would reopen in 1562 and eventually end in 1563 with the final draft of the Counter Reformation or Catholic Reformation.

<h3>Description</h3>
In as much as you are now just starting that journey that is this earthly life which I, as you can see, have for the most part completed... I have taken it upon myself to show you... those places in which I fear you may easily fail or fall... if you follow my advice, you may stay on the right path towards the salvation of your soul as well as for the praise and honour of your distinguished and noble family. 'Giovanni Della Casa, Treatise on Good Manners, 1551'. That treatise called il Galateo and named after Galeazzo (in latin Galatheus) Florimonte, a bishop who requested this composition, is a prime written example of how good manners are to be taught. Della Casa presented himself as a wise, older man seeking to smooth the social path of the young nobleman through the use of proper etiquette, tempering his actions and demeanor to suit those with whom he is keeping company, to act in moderation, and to do 'dirty, foul, repulsive, or disgusting things' only outside the company of others and giving importance of dressing in harmony with one's social rank and dressing in accordance of the norms of one's community. That treatise was a huge success amongst the nobles at those times.

<h3>Description</h3>
The loss of Cyprus in 1571, triggered the formation of a Holy League, mainly formed by Spain, Venice and Papal States, with the combined fleet under command of Don Juan de Austria. The interests of Venice and Spain were very different: Venice wanted to recover Cyprus, and Spain wanted to recover her North African presidios, and they could only agree in fighting the Ottoman navy. The ensuing battle at Lepanto was the biggest naval battle in modern times with over 32,000 casualties (by comparison Trafalgar had only 3,000), 25,000 of them in the Ottoman side. The Ottoman fleet was almost completely destroyed. News of the victory were extremely well received by the Christians that suffered the Ottoman and Barbary piracy. Although the Ottomans rebuilt their fleet and recaptured Tunis a second time in 1574, their naval supremacy in the Mediterranean was destroyed forever.

<h3>Description</h3>
When in 1570 the Turks sent an ultimatum to Venice asking for the ceding of Cyprus and then invaded the island after the Republic of San Marco failed to respond, a great uproar was created in the Catholic world by the facts and rumors of Ottoman atrocities in the last Christian bastion of the eastern Mediterranean. After a first failure in the summer of 1570, Pope Pius V managed to convince major Catholic nations (except France) to join a Holy League against the heathens Turks, and it was proclaimed in May 1571. The League would lead to the great naval victory of Don Juan on the Turks at Lepanto, but would not outlast this first and final triumph. Selim II is rumored to have said, after the news he had lost 200 galleys at Lepanto: At Lepanto, the Christians have shaved me. At Cyprus, I cut their arm. My beard will grow again.

Proclaimed by Gregory XIII who undertook to reform the calender (henceforth called the Gregorian calender). This Pope founded the Roman College, later called the Gregorian University (1572) and many other roman colleges. He instituted the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary for the Battle of Lepanto. Among the pilgrims were Cardinal St Charles Borromeo, St Felix of Cantalice, St Gaetano of Thiene and the poet Torquato Tasso who alluded to it in 'Jerusalem Freed' (canto XI).

<h3>Description</h3>
The Gregorian calendar was proposed by Aloysius Lilius, a physician from Naples, and adopted by Pope Gregory XIII in accordance with instructions from the Council of Trent (1545-1563) to correct for errors in the older Julian Calendar. In February, 1582, Pope Gregory XIII issued a Papal Bull requiring that 10 days should be dropped from October 1582 so that 15 October should follow immediately after 4 October, and from then on the reformed calendar should be used. This was observed in Italy, Poland, Portugal, and Spain. Other Catholic countries followed shortly after, the Rest of the World adopted it only after 1700. In most countries it was also decided to adopt 1 January as the start of the year at the same time. In the Gregorian calendar, the tropical year is approximated as 365 97/400 days = 365.2425 days. Thus it takes approximately 3300 years for the tropical year to shift one day with respect to the Gregorian calendar. The approximation 365 97/400 is achieved by having 97 leap years every 400 years. These are calculated introducing a new corrective device to curb further error: century years such as 1700 or 1800 are no longer to be counted as leap years, unless they are like 1600 divisible by 400. If somewhat inelegant, this system was undeniably effective since the Gregorian calendar differed from solar year only by 26 seconds.

<h3>Description</h3>
Italian Jesuite missionary, in 1578 Ricci was sent to the Indies to work at Goa and Cochin and then in 1582 called to Macao to enter China. In 1583 he settled in Guangdong, studying the language and culture. He found ready acceptance among some officials, for the Chinese took an intense interest in his possessions, such as clocks and Western paintings. Only in 1601 he was allowed entrance to the capital Beijing at the Imperial court of Wanli. There he became a court mathematician and astronomer. Although he made few converts, he brought Christianity into good repute. Unlike missionaries in South Asia, he found that Chinese culture was strongly tied to Confucian values and concluded that Christianity had to be adapted to Chinese culture in order to take root. He called himself a Western Confucian. He was renowned for his great understanding of Chinese culture. He helped translate many Western works on mathematics and the sciences into Chinese. His maps were eagerly perused by the Chinese, who gained from him their first notion of modern Europe. In return, Ricci sent back to Europe the first modern detailed report on China. He composed a number of treatises, the principal being a catechism, True Doctrine of God, which was widely printed in China.

<h3>Description</h3>
Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina was appointed 'maestro di cappella' of the Cappella Giulia in Rome in 1551, where he issued his first works. Palestrina's fame and influence rapidly increased through the wide diffusion of his published works. So great was his reputation that in 1577 he was asked to rewrite the church's main plainchant books, following the Council of Trent's guidelines. His most famous mass, 'Missa Papae Marcelli', may have been composed to satisty the council's requirements for musical cogency and textual intelligibility. Palestrina ranks as one of the greatest Renaissance masters. In his sacred music he assimilated and refined his predecessors' polyphonic techniques to produce a 'seamless' texture, with all voices perfectly balanced. The nobility and restraint of his most expressive works established the almost legendary reverence that has long surrounded his name.

<h3>Description</h3>
Sixtus V was a born ruler and especially suited to stem the tide of disorder and lawlessness which had broken out towards the end of the reign of Gregory XIII. Having obtained the co-operation of the neighbouring states, he exterminated, often with excessive cruelty, the system of brigandage which had reached immense proportions and terrorized the whole of Italy. The number of bandits in and about Rome at the death of Gregory XIII has been variously estimated at from twelve to twenty-seven thousand, and in little more than two years after the accession of Sixtus V the Papal States had become the most secure country in Europe. Of almost equal importance with the extermination of the bandits was, in the opinion of Sixtus V, the rearrangement of the papal finances. At his accession the papal exchequer was empty. Acting on his favourite principle that riches as well as severity are necessary for good government, he used every available means to replenish the state treasury. By the sale of offices, the establishment of new 'Monti' and by levying new taxes, he accumulated a vast surplus, which he stored up against certain specified emergencies, such as a crusade or the defence of the Holy See. He prided himself upon his hoard, but the method by which it had been amassed was financially unsound: some of the taxes proved ruinous, and the withdrawal of so much money from circulation could not fail to cause distress. He did not consider that in the long run so much dead capital withdrawn from circulation was certain to impoverish the country and deal the death-blow to commerce and industry. Though extremely economical in other ways, Sixtus V spent immense sums of money in erection of public works in Rome like rebuilding countless churches, beautifying streets and erecting new buildings and monuments. Far-reaching were the reforms which Sixtus V introduced in the management of ecclesiastical affairs. He limited the College of Cardinals to seventy and established fifteen permanent cardinalitial congregations, some of which were concerned with spiritual, others with temporal affairs. Although these congregations lessened the work of the Pope, they didn't limit in any way his authority, because the final decision always belonged to the Pope.

<h3>Description</h3>
Michelangelo Merisi, one of the most extraordinary painters in the history of art, was born in 1571 not far from the village of Caravaggio (near Milan) where his family came from and after which he named himself. In 1592, he moved to the 'Rome of the Popes' with the prospect of large and lucrative commissions. Once there his painting skills attracted the attention of patrons who gave him also food and lodgings. In the beginning, all of Caravaggio's early paintings were relatively small works, still-lifes, genre-scenes and a few occasional religious subjects: it was said he had used a prostitute as the model for some of his depictions of the Virgin Mary. The big chance came in 1597 with the commission of two large paintings for the Contarelli Chapel in San Luigi dei Francesi about St Matthew's life. This commission made him famous as much as his life-style and violent behaviour made him notorious everywhere. His name appeared regularly in the protocols of the Roman police, however he received support and protection by some of the most sophisticated patrons in Rome. But in 1606 his violent temper didn't save him from murdering a person with whom he, unwilling to pay a bet on a real tennis match, got involved in a fierce fight. In hiding himself Caravaggio left Rome and went to Naples where, waiting for the Papal pardon which would allow him to return, he did some paintings. With no answer from Rome, Caravaggio left Naples and in the following year arrived on the island of Malta. In his stay on the island he painted his masterpiece 'the Beheading of St John', for which he was made Knight of the Order of Obedience. Soon his 'tormented nature' led him to quarrel with a noble knight and subsequently to escape from the island. Back to Rome he was imprisoned because of his former killing, however he managed to escape and flee to Sicily and then to Naples where he was badly wounded by two hired killers. In 1610 he decided to leave Naples and set sail to Porto Ercole in the Spanish held State of Presidi, at only 80 km far from Rome waiting for the Papal pardon. But there he was mistakenly captured by the local police and imprisoned for some days. After his release, discovering that his boat had sailed away with all of his poor belongings still on board, he was seen running insanely along the shore until he fell unconscious, caught by a raging fever which brought him to death a few days after. He was only 38 years old...

Proclaimed by Clement VIII. It opened on Dec 31st 1599 due to the illness of the Pope and closed on Jan 13th 1601. The Masons spoke of 3 million pilgrims. It was a most solemn year celebrated by many confraternities. The Pope paid 70 visits to the basilicas and fasted on bread and water every Wedneday and Saturday. He took upon himself to wash the feet of pilgrims in the hospices and served them at the table. For many hours he would listen to confessions in St Peter's. Meanwhile St Camillus of Lellis started the Hospital of St Mary Magdalene to care for sick pilgrims. Peoples from all Europe came to Rome during that year. St Robert Bellarmine was actively involved.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Accademia dei Lincei was founded in 1603 in Rome by the young Prince Federico Cesi and his friends, Anastasio Di Filiis, Johannes Van Heeck, and Francesco Stelluti. It aimed at a radical renewal of scientific knowledge and it encouraged a vigorous critical approach to the dominant Aristotelian philosophy. They chose the lynx as their emblem, to stress the importance of sharp and penetrating insight into nature. The Academy realized the revolutionary importance of the celestial discoveries that Galileo made with his new telescope in 1610. Nevertheless, the Academy did not survive the death of Prince Federico Cesi in 1630.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1501, Cardinal Oliviero Carafa decided to make Parione district the social center of Rome. He took over Palazzo Orsini and ordered Donato Bramante to restore the palace. During this work, a marble statue was discovered in the foundation. The unidentified statue had neither legs nor arms, the face was without a nose and the eyes were ghost-like. Nevertheless, the Cardinal found it appealing and put it on a marble pedestal in a small square. Each April 25, Cardinal Oliviero chaired a Latin literary competition in which sonnets were posted on the statue. The residents carried on with the practice of adapting literary poems into satire, a pasquinade, exhibited in a public place. That's how Pasquino became the first talking statue of Rome. He spoke out about people's dissatisfaction, he denounced injustice, and he assaulted the nepotistic system and the misgovernment of the Church. Severe laws however were issued to stop the practice and Pasquino was put under surveillance. This led to the undesired result of multiplying the talking statues of Rome. So the so-called Congress of the Witty was formed, with Pasquino always the leader, and Marforio, Abate Luigi, Madama Lucrezia, Facchino and Babbuino as his cohorts. The most famous pasquinade was against Pope Urbanus VIII Barberini by 'saying' -What the Barbarians did not do the Barberini did- after he used the bronze tiles of the Pantheon for the Bernini's Canopy in St Peter's Dome in 1624.

Proclaimed by Urban VIII, the Pope who founded Propaganda Fide and consecrated St Peter's Basilica after its reconstruction. The Pope conferred on the cardinals the title of Eminence and Prince of the Church. In Rome that year the plague struck and claimed many pilgrims. The Tibur again burst its banks so that the Pope had to substitute the Basilica of St Paul for St Mary in Trastevere where the Holy Door was opened. The first capuchin saint Felix of Cantalice was canonised.

<h3>Description</h3>
Galileo is chiefly remembered for his work on free fall, his use of the telescope and his employment of experimentation. He made a series of telescopes with which he saw mountains on the Moon, proved the Milky Way was made up of tiny stars, and saw four small bodies orbiting Jupiter. Galileo became 'Mathematician and Philosopher' to the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In Florence he continued his work on motion and mechanics and began to get involved in disputes about Copernicanism. Copernicanism was in contradiction with Scripture, and in 1616 Galileo was given some kind of warning that he was not to defend Copernicanism. Just what was said on this occasion was to become a subject for dispute when Galileo was accused of departing from this undertaking in his 'Dialogue concerning the two greatest world systems'. In October 1632 he was summoned by the Holy Office to Rome. The tribunal passed a sentence condemning him and compelled Galileo to abjure his theory.

<h3>Description</h3>
Ongoing tensions between the Curia and Farnese of Parma had developed into a blood-feud. Relations further deteriorated when Duke Odoardo quarrelled with Pope Urban VIII's Barberini nephews while at Rome in 1639. The offended nephews induced their uncle to ban Parmesan grain shipments into Rome, depriving the Duke of funds needed to repay his Roman creditors. When these creditors also appealed to Urban for help, the Pope had found a pretext (like Papal seizure of Ferrera 1598 and Urbino 1631) to occupy Odoardo's Duchy of Castro. It was the beginning of the Castro Wars.

<h3>Description</h3>
It all began when Corsican Guards, upon orders, pursued a man wanted for debts up to gardens of the Cardinal d'Este's palace. The French prelate's men protected the fugitive and repelled the Pope's guards, twice. A strong enmity ensued between French people in Rome and Corsican Guards, culminating on 20th August 1662 when a violent brawl between Corsicans and soldiers of the French ambassador, the Duke of Crйquy, took place in a tavern. In the evening, the Duke's palace was assaulted and the ambassadress's carriage was even shot at. Six men died, including a civilian who happened to belong to the Duke's household. Louis XIV reacted immediately by sending back the Nuncio from Paris, invaded the Comtat- Venaissin and asked for the Corsican Guard to be entirely disbanded and for the Corsicans to be declared unfit to serve the Papal States. Before that, fifty of its members would have to be hanged and three-hundred and fifty others sent to the galleys.<br />So far we have able to delay our answer, but the Most Christian King is now getting impatient.

<h3>Description</h3>
In the late XVIIth century, the disuse of the Mediterranean sea as the main international trade junction between Europa and the East Indies brought the Italian economic system to collapse. Italy became more removed from the mainstream of European development and each local administration along the peninsula lagged behind that of any other European contemporary. The practice of agriculture as prevailing economic activity meant the coming back to power of the most conservative landowning aristocracy. That economic backwardness associated with the effects of Counterreform deeply affected Italian social life too, now less and less inclined to accept innovation and to develop some entrepreneurial attitude.

<h3>Description</h3>
Proclaimed by Innocent XII, but closed by Clement XI because the Pope died on Sep 27th, 1700, and his successor was elected only on Nov 9th, 1700. This Jubilee saw 2 Popes just like the 3rd (1390) and the 10th (1550). It was an austere Jubilee without revelry. Innocent was a very pious Pope who condemned nepotism explicitly. He created the Congregation for Religious and condemned Jansenism. He died a saintly man. Participating in the Jubilee were Queen Maria Casimir of Poland with two sons, visiting the basilicas barefooted. The Grand Duke of Tuscany Cosmos III came and was made a canon of St Peter's. Once again the Tibur overflowed and St Paul's basilica could be reached only by boat.

On several occasions since 1645, the Jesuit missionaries in China were criticized because they were letting their converts worship their ancestors. The Jesuits explained that it was only a courtesy and an act of filial piety that was facilitating the acceptation of the Christianity in the very traditional Chinese society. In 1704, Rome forbad for good this practice, bringing about the expulsion of all missionaries and the persecution of the Chinese converts.

<h3>Description</h3>
On several occasions since 1645, the Jesuit missionaries in China were criticized because they were letting their converts worship their ancestors. The Jesuits explained that it was only a courtesy and an act of filial piety that was facilitating the acceptation of the Christianity in the very traditional Chinese society. In 1704, Rome forbad for good this practice, bringing about the expulsion of all missionaries and the persecution of the Chinese converts.

<h3>Description</h3>
Proclaimed by Benedict XIII, an austere dominican who would kneel when writing to his Superior General. The Pope wanted an austere Jubilee without the usual illuminations and pageantry. During the Holy Year, a council of italian bishops was called at St John Lateran to legislate matters on discipline and catechetics. Clerics were prohibited from wearing wigs and playing the lottery. The Congregation of Mercedaraians managed to collect sufficient money to redeem 3,710 slaves who arrived in Rome from Tunisia. They were blessed by the Pope and each received a medal and a sum of money. For the first time a trained horse was given to the Pope by the King of Naples in the Piazza Santi Apostoli. 10 saints were canonised among whom were St Pellegrino Laziosi, St John of the Cross, St Louis Gonzaga, St Stanislaw Kostka, St John Nepomuceno.

The Holy Year was preached by St Leonard of Port Maurice in the piazzas of Rome. The Pope even insituted the Way of the Cross in the Coloseum. He was the first to prescribe Communion as well as Confession for obtaining the indulgence. Over a million people gathered in Rome including some 200,000 Armenians and 2 bishops.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1540 Pope Paulus III recognized the Jesuite Order, created 1534 by the Spaniard Don Iсigo Lуpez de Recalade, better know as Ignatius of Loyola. He becomes one of the most devoted counter reformists and enemy #1 of the protestant movement. Loyola having a soldier background makes its mark on the order, which is organized almost as an army. High priority was given both to educating missionaries but also counselors for European royal courts. This made the Jesuite order very powerful in the politic scene. 1773 the Jesuite order was dissolved by Pope Pius VI due to pressure from Christian countries in the age of enlightenment. 1814 the Jesuite order was reinstituted, however just as a faint shadow of the powerful order it once had been.

<h3>Description</h3>
Proclaimed by Clement XIV who died on Sep 22nd 1774. He organised the Missions in the 4 piazzas of Rome and wanted to personally help in it. Before his death he was obliged to suppress the Company of Jesus much to his relutance (1773). The suppression was required to keep the unity of the Church during the reactionary events that overtook society. The Jubilee was celebrated in subdued tones by Pius VI who was elected on Feb 15th 1775. About 300,000 pilgrims were at the Jubilee. Holy Thursday saw a procession of 100 oriental bishops in their splendid vestments. Numbered among the pilgrims was Maximillian of Austria. Confessors were authorised to grant dispensation to pilgrims regarding the visits to the 4 basilicas in particular cases.

<h3>Description</h3>
Cagliostro is widely held to have been an alias for the charlatan Giuseppe Balsamo, a petty criminal who, in his most famous crime, claimed aptitude in alchemy to swindle a man out of his gold. Cagliostro himself claimed to have been born of Christians of noble birth, but abandoned as an orphan upon the island of Malta, to have travelled as a child to Medina, Mecca and Cairo and upon return to Malta to have been initiated into the Sovereign Military Order of the Knights of Malta, with whom he studied alchemy, the Kabala and magic. Well known in Rome and Naples, he then travelled to London, where he was initiated into Freemasonry and in The Hague he founded the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry. He travelled also throughout Russia, Germany, and later France, spreading the influence of the Egyptian Rite and also claiming to be a magnetic healer of great power. In France he was prosecuted in the affair of the diamond necklace which involved Marie Antoinette, imprisoned for fraud, he was then acquitted. Asked to leave he went to England, where he managed to refute accusations made to him of being Giuseppe Balsamo and forced a retraction and apology from his detractors. In 1789 Cagliostro left England to visit Rome, where he was arrested by the Inquisition on the charge of being a Mason. Imprisoned and tortured, he was sentenced to death, changed in life imprisonment by the Pope. Cagliostro died in a dungeon in 1795.

<h3>Description</h3>
In 1800 the 20th Jubilee was to be celebrated, but the difficult political situation of the Church during the French Revolutionary Wars prevented Pius VII from proclaiming it. Unfortunately Napolйon was intentioned to vassalize the Pope and to force him to accept French cardinals, but when the Pope clearly refused to submit to his will he was imprisoned and transferred to France. In 1798 from his 'captivity' in France, while the Repubblica Romana was ruling in the Papal States, Pius VI ordered some cardinals to proceed in any case with the traditional papal election once he had died. So, on 14 March 1800, soon after Pius VI's death, a new Pope, Pius VII, was elected in St. George's monastery in Venice. Since it was too late to proclaim a Jubilee for that current year, on 24 May 1800 Pope Pius VII issued a papal bull 'Quod hoc inquente', with which he conceded the jubilary indulgence to anyone who, in the following 15 days, would have gone to confessions, received communions and visited churches, and not necessarily in Rome. The year 1800 was the only one hundredth year and the only one year to begin a century since 1300 in which the Holy Year couldn't be celebrated. Also, 1800 it isn't numbered as the 20th amongst the ordinary Holy Years. The 20th Holy Year was proclaimed on 24 may 1824 and celebrated in 1825 by Pope Leo XII after 50 years from the previous one. In that Jubilee St Mary of Trastevere took the place of the St Paul's Basilica as pilgrimage site since the latter was being rebuilt after a fire. The Jubilee saw the participation of 375000 pilgrims.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Council held in Constance from 1414 to 1418 brought an end to the Great Schism, declared its superiority over the Papacy, deposed two of the claimants popes (Gregorius XII elected in Rome and supported by Bayern, Naples, Hungary and Venice and Benedictus XIII elected in Avignon and supported by France, Castile, Aragon and Scotland) and pressed to abdicate the third (Johannes XXIII elected in the council of Pisa) and eventually chose a new pontiff, Martinus V. In spite of what had been decreed by the council of Constance, Benedictus XIII, Pedro de Luna, although deposed, continued to proclaim himself as the only legitimate Pope elected in Avignon. He also declared that the election of a new Pope to end the Great Schism could have been made according to his personal decision only and that he certainly would have confirmed himself as the new pontiff. Abandoned by his main supporters, the Kings of Aragon, Castile and Scotland amongst them, and due to his obstinacy Benedictus XIII preferred to retire in the fortress of Peсiscola near Valencia where he died in 1423. Stirred up by Alfons V hostile to Martinus V in the succession of Naples, the cardinals still faithful to the last Antipope elected a new successor, Clemens VIII, but that new Pope had authority only in Aragon and in 1429 he decided to submit to the Roman pontiff. His submission definitely put an end to the Great Schism of the Western Church.

<h3>Description</h3>
In the fight for the reacquisition of the Church territories, the Queen sent her best condottiero, Muzio Attendolo, 'lo Sforza', commander of Neapolitan troops to help the Pope against Braccio da Montone. Although both Muzio Attendolo Sforza and Braccio da Montone came from the Alberico da Barbiano's Compagnia di Ventura di San Giorgio, they had different approaches to strategic-tactical warfare, the 'Scuola Sforzesca' based mainly upon coordinated field manoeuvres and planned tactics and the 'Scuola Braccesca' based mainly upon energic assaults and the element of surprise. In their first battle against each other Fortebraccio (da Montone's nickname) prevailed. Informed of M. Attendolo Sforza's defeat, the Queen welcomed Pope's request of more troops in order to stop da Montone. However Martinus V managed to come to terms with da Montone promising him a title in exchange for his military services in retaking the Church territories. The order was finally re-established in the Papal States.

<h3>Description</h3>
For more then ten years Northern Italy was the war theater of 'Mercenari' at disposal of the best offerer between Milan and the other Italian states united in a League originally formed by Venice and Florence. It was to the interest of all soldiers of fortune of both sides to make the operations last as long as possible, to avoid decisive operations and to liberate all prisoners quickly. Consequently the campaign were very exhausting and dragged on interminably, some battles were won and others lost, truces and peace treaties were made only to be broken, and no definite result was achieved. A peace treaty was also stipulated in Ferrara in 1428 in which at first Visconti stated to renounce claims to territories lying beyond the Panaro-Magra Rivers, but refused to concede the territories of Bergamo and Brescia to Venice, which was still occupying with her troops. Political and economic interests of both sides were conflicting and when the new Pope, Eugenius IV, was being suspected of involvement with the League to damage Milan, Visconti retaliated sending his troops to invade the Papal States. That represented a violation of the peace treaty and subsequently a new Antivisconti League was formed to wage war against Milan.

<h3>Description</h3>
In spite of their victories in Northern Italy, the French troops were forced to abandon the battlefield both because of financial reasons and because after the successful battle of Ravenna the Emperor was withdrawing troops and would have joined the holy league formed by Papal States, Spain, England and Venice with the help of Swiss troops hired by Pope Julius II himself and led into war by the Bishop of Sion, Mathias Schiner. Thence the decision to withdraw from Milan. Julius II recovered Ravenna, Bologna and the rest of the Romagna, while his commander, the Duke of Urbino, easily occupied Reggio and Modena, though Alfonso d'Este refused any settlement that would deprive him of Ferrara. After having chased out the French from Italy, the congress of allies which met at Mantua in August made over to the Pope Parma and Piacenza, to which he had at best a shadowy claim. The Emperor and Fernando would have been glad to give Milan to their grandson Charles but the Swiss were in possession and, supported by the Pope, made their will good. The duchy was given to Ercole Massimiliano Sforza, the elder son of Ludovico. The Venetian claims were left unsettled with Brescia still held out and the Swiss claiming Cremona and the Ghiara d'Adda for the duchy. And more, the Emperor demanded Vicenza and Verona. Florence, who in 1509 had ended her long war by the recovery of Pisa, was punished for her support of France by the restoration of the Medici. Entering Milan, Ercole Massimiliano Sforza received the keys to the city from the Swiss soldiers, who promised to protect the duchy of Milan and to help the Duke in sending to him all the troops he would need. The Duke granted them the acquisition of the ducal territories Ticino and Valtellina, the most important accesses to the Alpine passes. Genoa drew back its allegiance to the French King, who in 1506 harshly repressed a local rebellion that broke out owing to the decision taken by the French governor to grant privileges to the nobilty. But Julius II made also a treaty with his late ally, Maximilian, against Venice. The emperor was to support the Lateran council to oppose that one proclaimed by Louis XII in Pisa and to hand over Modena to the Pope, while Julius II was to join in compelling Venice to give up the fiefs which the Emperor claimed since Cambrai and to use on behalf of his new ally also the always convincing 'spiritual weapons'. When this treaty was made public, it had only the effect to drive Venice to side with France.

When Duca Vincenzo II Gonzaga died, Mantova descended into civil war. Against Gonzaga's wishes, the Duca di Guastalla claimed a throne meant for his cousin Mayenne with the blessings of Imperatore Ferdinando II and his allies Filipo IV of Spain and Carlo Emmanule I of Savoja. Hoping to free Italy from Spanish hegemony, His Holiness Urban VIII helped Mayenne and his father Nevers by occupying the Valtelline Pass - delying Ferdinando II's troops from linking with the Spaniards at Casale. Papal legate Jules Mazarin later joined Luigi XIII of France to finalize the Peace of Susa (Apr 1630).

Giovanna of Anjou-Durazzo was not destined to be Queen, and when she found herself with the crown of Naples on her head after the death of her brother, she refused to give up her previous dissolute life. She soon started to yield the power to whoever happened to be her current paramour. The nobility was restless and conspirative. Pope Martinus V, as his predecessors, wanted to see Naples in the firm hands of a trusted man, but as a previous arranged marriage to Jean of Bourbon had failed, and Giovanna was now 50 years old, he decided to invest Louis III of Anjou, Count of Provence, of the junior branch of the House of Anjou, with claims to Naples. Martinus and Louis recruited the help of Neapolitan condottiero Muzio Attendolo, also known as 'lo Sforza'. When Sforza's army invaded Naples, Giovanna turned to Alfons V of Aragon, who had also distant claims to the crown of Naples, and in exchange for his help, adopted him as heir. Alfons arrived to Naples with his forces, and made Braccio da Montone, Sforza's greatest rival, commander of the Neapolitan armies.

After receiving checked for heresy and forwarded Luther's letter, Leo X responded over the next three years, ''with great care as is proper,'' by deploying a series of papal theologians and envoys against Luther.

<h3>Description</h3>
After his release from Milan, Alfons of Aragon returned to Naples, where his brother Pedro had conquered Gaeta. Naples was defended by Isabelle of Lorraine with the support of Pope Eugenius IV. For three years Alfons conducted as much a diplomatic war as a military one, gaining allies to his cause from the Neapolitan nobles. In 1438, Renй of Anjou paid a huge ransom to Burgundy for his release, and arrived in the Kingdom, but since he had exhausted his funds his allies abandoned him and he had to retreat to Naples. A long siege was then established, during which the Infante Don Pedro was killed by a chance shot to the great grief of his brother. The support of the Genoese fleet allowed Renй to sustain the besieged capital with success until 1 June 1442, when 300 Aragonese well-armed men entered the town through an open drain accessible during the dry season, revealed to Alfons' son Ferrante by some prisoners. After several hours of fighting and in spite of the stealthy move inside the city walls, Naples withstood the Aragonese and Alfons was forced to retreat to Sicily. After recovering the rest of the Kingdom, Renй entered the capital in triumph the year after. Pope Eugenius IV, very happy for the Angevin success, invested Renй as King of Naples and Sicily thus declaring Alfons of Aragon in unlawful possession of the Sicilian island.

<h3>Description</h3>
Having always been hostile to Muzio Attendolo Sforza, the celebrated condottiero, Gianni Caracciolo, Giovanna's favourite advisor and lover, managed to induce the Queen to refuse the Pope's request of more troops in order to stop da Montone. In spite of her refusal and thanks to the mediation of Florence, Martinus V managed however to come to terms with da Montone promising him a title in exchange for his military services. Finally the Papal troops commanded by Braccio da Montone himself succeeded in retaking the Church territories. As soon as the order in his States was re-established and in order to punish Giovanna for her unexpected refusal to send troops, the Pope offered the crown of Naples to the junior House of the Angevins, always interested in the succession to the throne of Naples, proclaiming Louis III d'Anjou 'King of Naples' on 4 December 1419.

<h3>Description</h3>
In the fight for the reacquisition of the Church territories, the Queen sent her best condottiero, Muzio Attendolo, 'lo Sforza', commander of Neapolitan troops to help the Pope against Braccio da Montone. Although both Muzio Attendolo Sforza and Braccio da Montone came from the Alberico da Barbiano's Compagnia di Ventura di San Giorgio, they had different approaches to strategic-tactical warfare, the 'Scuola Sforzesca' based mainly upon coordinated field manoeuvres and planned tactics and the 'Scuola Braccesca' based mainly upon energic assaults and the element of surprise. In their first battle against each other Fortebraccio (da Montone's nickname) prevailed. Informed of M. Attendolo Sforza's defeat, having always been hostile to the celebrated condottiero, Gianni Caracciolo, Giovanna's favourite advisor and lover, managed to induce the Queen to refuse the Pope's request of more troops in order to stop da Montone. In spite of her refusal and thanks to the mediation of Florence, Martinus V managed however to come to terms with da Montone promising him a title in exchange for his military services. Finally the Papal troops commanded by Braccio da Montone himself succeeded in retaking the Church territories. As soon as the order in his States was re-established and in order to punish Giovanna for her unexpected refusal to send troops, the Pope offered the crown of Naples to the junior House of the Angevins, always interested in the succession to the throne of Naples, proclaiming Louis III d'Anjou 'King of Naples' on 4 December 1419.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Spanish hegemony in the Italian peninsula was exercised by means of heavy bureaucracy and harsh taxation directly in the Habsburg dominions of Milan and Naples and indirectly in the rest of the peninsula by forcing the other minor Italian states to respect Spanish economic and diplomatic directives. The vassalage to Spain, which granted to some extent an enduring peace in Italy afer the Italian Wars, which the historians would call 'the pax hispanica', together with the disuse of the Mediterranean sea as international trade route towards the East Indies brought the Italian economic system to eventually collapse. As a result of this agriculture will become the prevailing economic activity in Italy until the end of XIXth century. That meant the coming back to power of the landowning aristocracy.

<h3>Description</h3>
After his release from Milan, Alfons returned to Naples, where his brother Pedro had conquered Gaeta. Naples was defended by Isabelle of Lorraine with the support of Pope Eugenius IV. For three years Alfonso conducted as much a diplomatic war as a military one, gaining allies to his cause from the Neapolitan nobles. In 1438, Renй of Anjou paid a huge ransom to Burgundy for his release, and arrived in the Kingdom, but since he had exhausted his funds his allies abandoned him and he had to retreat to Naples. A long siege was then established, during which the Infante Don Pedro was killed by a chance shot to the great grief of his brother. The support of the Genoese fleet allowed Renй to sustain the besieged capital, but finally on June 1, 1442, 300 well-armed men entered the town through an open drain accesible during the dry season, revealed to Alfons' son Ferrante by some prisoners. After several hours of fighting, Naples was conquered and Renй escaped to Florence. After conquering the rest of the Kingdom, Alfons entered the capital in triumph on February 23, 1443. Pope Eugenius refused to invest Alfons as King of Naples and threatened to declare him in unlawful possession of Naples, Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia. Alfons threatened back with his support for an anti-Pope, Felix V, chosen at the Council of Basel, and Eugenius accepted to invest him in exchange for his support as the genuine Pope and help against the Turks that never materialized. Ferrante was named Prince of Calabria, and the Neapolitans were pleased that their Kingdom was not going to be incorporated to Aragon. Alfons, who as a Castilian had always felt a foreigner in Barcelona, never returned to Aragon, and his court in Naples was filled with the splendor of the Renaissance. Alfons soon gained the nickname of the Magnanimous.

<h3>Description</h3>
Because of having established control over Lombardy and submitted Genoa, Filippo Maria Visconti clearly showed his intention to continue with the ambitious plan which his father Giangaleazzo once pursued: the unification of the whole Northern Italy under the Visconti's blazon. Romagna should have been Visconti's next step in his threatening hegemonic plan. But Invading Romagna, the duke of Milan would break the 1420 peace treaty stipulated with the Florentine Republic as to guarantee 10 years of non-belligerence. That treaty notably forbade Visconti from intervening in the lands beyond Panaro-Magra Rivers and so in Romagna and Tuscany, territories in which Florence directly exercised her influence. Florentine army alone was not enough powerful to face the Milanese well paid Mercenari. A League against Visconti urged immediately.

<h3>Description</h3>
On the 24 of February 1525, in the battle of Pavia, the imperial armies led by Ferdinando Francesco d'Avalos, Marquis of Pescara (also winner at Bicocca in 1522), decimated the French troops led by King Franзois Ier. Many French leaders died on the battlefield, such as De la Tremoille, La Palice and Bonnivet. King Franзois Ier, instead, fell from his horse shot out under him, and taken captive. Since 24 February was Charles V's 25th birthday, the Valois was the biggest gift he could ever receive. Franзois was carted off to Madrid, where he was held six months in prison for ransom, and pressed to renounce his claims in Italy and Flanders, to give Bourgogne back to the Empire and to concede the county of Provence to Charles, Connйtable de Bourbon, and now leader of the imperial troops. The Emperor believed that the peace with France had finally been achieved after Franзois Ier, agreeing to renounce his claims in Italy, was freed and retaken to France, leaving his sons there as hostages and guarantees for the respect of the treaty. But within two months of his release and in spite of his sons taken as hostages in Spain, Franзois Ier got the Parliament of Paris to void all the terms of the Treaty of Madrid because accepted under duress and in 1526 at Cognac he stipulated a holy league bringing into it Pope Clement VII together with Florence, Venice, Henry VIII of England and also the Duke of Milan, who even if previously restored to the throne by Charles V himself, voluntarily joined the alliance made to stop the Spanish hegemony over Italy.

<h3>Description</h3>
Alfons of Aragon, after being adopted by Giovanna of Anjou-Durazzo, arrived at the Kingdom of Naples with the intention of being recognised as its legitimate ruler, due mainly to his descent from the last Hohenstaufen King of Sicily, and not due to the will of a member of an usurping dynasty, the House of Anjou. He wanted to take control of Naples immediately without waiting for the Queen's death. He soon imprisoned Caracciolo, Giovanna's lover, but he failed to capture the Queen. Muzio Attendolo Sforza, the Neapolitan condottiero in the service of the Pope, informed that Giovanna was in great danger, went hastily to Naples and rescued her. It was then easy for the Pope to convince the Queen to adopt Louis III of Anjou, Count of Provence, instead of Alfons of Aragon. Taking advantage of the absence of Alfons due to his problems in Aragon, and with the military help of Visconti, Duke of Milan and Signore of Genoa, the Aragonese were expelled from Naples, and Giovanna appointed Louis as Duke of Calabria, the heir's title. Louis moved his court to Cosenza to arrange his stay in Italy.

<h3>Description</h3>
On 7 April 1498, upon Charles VIII's death at Amboise (he knocked his head while passing through a doorway in his going to see a game of real tennis), the throne passed to his cousin Louis of Orlйans, who reigned as Louis XII of France. On his accession, he took the titles of Duke of Milan and King of Sicily, sending a shrounding chill through Italy, especially to Ludovico Sforza, who had seized Milan from his nephew Gian Galeazzo, and that upon his death, had seen his claim legitimized by Maximilian King of the Romans. Louis XII came to throne in France with the clear idea of avenging his previous defeat by Ludovico and make good his claim to Milan from his Visconti grandmother. Milan and her dependency, Genoa, were seen as the key to Italy. So Louis XII, preparing to make good his claim on Milan, wanted to enlist the help of the main Italian powers, to avoid the mistakes of his cousin Charles VIII. In the meanwhile the anti-Venetian sentiment had been running high, attempts were made by Italian ambassadors to poison the relationships between Venice and the Ottoman Empire and try to induce the latter to declare war to the former. It was clear that Venice could very well side with the French and that occurred with the stipulation of the treaty of Blois, where Venice would recognize French claims to Milan and in exchange for military support and money would receive the Milanese territories east of the Adda river. Louis then stipulated a peace treaty with Ferdinand of Spain and enforced the truce with Maximilian of Habsburg. He made also a pact with Pope Alexander VI: in exchange for a papal bull to annul his marriage to the crippled sister of late Charles VIII and marry Charles' widow, Anne of Brittany, the Pope's son, Cesare Borgia, received the duchy of Valentinois with the hand of Charlotte d'Albret, sister to the King of Navarre and a promise of French military support to form his own duchy in Romagna. After having secured his friendship with Philibert II of Savoy Louis XII crossed the Alps and assembled his powerful army in Asti, a small county in Piedmont that belonged to the House of Orlйans as marriage dowry of Valentina Visconti, his grandmother. In the summer of 1499, the French army led by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, a Milanese noble, invaded the duchy of Milan from West, in the meanwhile, a Venetian army attacked from East. Town after town surrendered and the Milanese armies disappeared. As soon as a revolt broke out in Milan, Ludovico left the city together with his family and his treasure. By September 1499 the French troops made their entrance in Milan warmly welcome by the population.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Emperor believed that peace had finally been achieved with France after Franзois Ier agreed to renounce his claims in Italy. But within two months of his release, Francis had retracted from his word and signed the league of Cognac, bringing into it the Pope, Milan, Florence, Venice and England. But for Giulio de Medici, Pope Clement VII, it was a huge mistake to take sides with France, as Rome was sacked by the Lutheran German mercenaries of Charles under lack of pay. Charles got his army under control, and Clement became his prisoner, and had to pay 300,000 ducats and surrender several fortresses for his release. But in the meantime, the Florentines had raised and expelled the Medici, declaring a Republic, and part of the Papal States also wanted to become independent. Now Clement needed Charles more than the emperor needed the Pope and a deal was struck. Charles agreed to restore the Papal States, to return Florence to Medici rule, to name Clement's illegitimate son from a black slave Alessandro Medici, il Moro, hereditary Duke of Florence and to give him his own illegitimate daughter from a Flemish servant, Margaret of Austria, in marriage. In exchange Clement will crown him as emperor and will become his lifelong ally. The treaty of Barcelona was signed on June 29, 1529, and Clement and Charles will meet at Bologna at the end of the year, with the crowning taking place on February 24, 1530 in the same city. Charles V will be the last Holy Roman Emperor to be crowned by a Pope. A consequence of this alliance will be that Clement will refuse the divorce of Henry VIII from the emperor's aunt, Catalina, even at the cost of driving England into Protestantism.

<h3>Description</h3>
Because of his distrustfulness of the barons, Ferdinando was pursuing a policy aimed at strengthening royal authority at the expense of them, that attitude brought him to have many enemies amongst the nobles of the Kingdom. In 1485, when his son, Alfonso Duke of Calabria, decided to revoke all the privileges that granted the city of Aquila a certain political autonomy towards the Kingdom, arresting the local nobles and occupying the city with his troops, the city magistrates refused to submit to him chasing the Neapolitan troops away and asking Pope Innocentius VIII for help and protection. The Pope, already put out by the fact that King Ferdinando didn't pay the 'chinea' (the annual tribute a Neapolitan fief has to give to the Pope as suzerain), accepted to help by sending troops to Aquila. In a rally immediately arranged in Melfi to discuss about Alfonso's aggression to Aquila, the nobles led by Antonello Petrucci, Count of Policastro and Francesco Coppola, Count of Sarno, King's ministers and by Antonello Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno, all hostile to the Aragonese rule, agreed to revolt against the King, who in the meanwhile refused to come to terms with them and confirm their feudal privileges. The revolt resulted in a civil war by which both Papal and Neapolitan territories were systematically devastated by the contending armies. On 11 august 1486 a permanent truce was eventually signed between Ferdinando, the Pope and the rebelling nobles, The King of Naples promised to pay the tribute due to the Church, to forgive the unfaithful barons and to assign Aquila under the Papal suzerainty.

<h3>Description</h3>
In the same way as his father did for him, at the end of his life Emperor Maximilian made attempts to keep the imperial title amongst the members of the House of Habsburg. But his son Philip died unexpectedly early in 1506, leaving two male heirs, Charles and Ferdinand which were respectively born in 1500 and 1503. Maximilian decided to support Charles, who in 1516 was already Archduke of Burgundy, King of Spain, Sicily and Naples, in his investiture as King of the Romans and future Holy Roman Emperor. But this diplomatic move would have been very expensive. Most of the German princes were already supporting the French candidate, King Franзois Ier. Maximilian seemed to successfully convoy the favour of the imperial electors towards the Habsburg cause, by means of granting investitures and making promises of large sums of money with the help of bankers such as the Fuggers and the Welsers. The Pope, who couldn't accept the presence of an Emperor with territorial claims in Italy as it was under the rule of Emperor Frederick II, would have supported a German prince like Friedrich III of Saxony, with no particular interest laying beyond the Alps. Looking for international credit, also Henry VIII King of England took part in the imperial election offering his candidature but withdrew soon after the first consultations.

<h3>Description</h3>
In late 1529, according to the treaty stipulated in Barcelona a few months before, Charles V came to Bologna to meet the Pope. Princes and ambassadors of all Italian states came to this encounter with the intention to confirm their allegiance to the Empire. Charles V used his strengthened political influence to definitely settle the Italian balance of powers and the conflicts between the Italian minors that deceitfully used to switch sides between France and the Empire. According to Mercurino da Gattinara's advices Charles V granted independence to all the imperial fiefs and, with the mediation of Pope Clemens VII, even to Francesco Sforza who was reinstated in his duchy in spite of his joining the league of Cognac. Pope Clemens VII instead, receiving the territory of Parma was to renounce his claims to Modena and Ferrara and to promise to arrange for a Concile in the next future to discuss about the Reform of the Church. Settled the political affairs in the peninsula, Charles was crowned by Pope Clement VII King of Italy on 22 February 1530 and Holy Roman Emperor two day later, in two solemn ceremonies arranged in Bologna. The imperial crown was a really big gift for his 30th birthday: Charles V resulted, in facts, the last Holy Roman Emperor in history to be personally crowned by the Pope.

<h3>Description</h3>
The Council held in Constance from 1414 to 1418 brought an end to the Great Schism, declared its superiority over the Papacy, deposed two of the claimants popes (Gregorius XII elected in Rome and supported by Bayern, Naples, Hungary and Venice and Benedictus XIII elected in Avignon and supported by France, Castile, Aragon and Scotland) and pressed to abdicate the third (Johannes XXIII elected in the council of Pisa) and eventually chose a new pontiff, Martinus V. In spite of what had been decreed by the council of Constance, Benedictus XIII, Pedro de Luna, although deposed, continued to proclaim himself as the only legitimate Pope elected in Avignon. He also declared that the election of a new Pope to end the Great Schism could have been made according to his personal decision only and that he certainly would have confirmed himself as the new pontiff. Abandoned by his main supporters, the Kings of Aragon, Castile and Scotland amongst them, and due to his obstinacy Benedictus XIII preferred to retire in the fortress of Peсiscola near Valencia where he died in 1423. Stirred up by Alfons V hostile to Martinus V in the succession of Naples, the cardinals still faithful to the last Antipope elected a new successor, Clemens VIII, but that new Pope had authority only in Aragon and in 1429 he decided to submit to the Roman pontiff. His submission definitely put an end to the Great Schism of the Western Church.

<h3>Description</h3>
Queen Giovanna of Naples is dead. Her last will was that the crown should be given to Renй of Anjou, brother of Louis III of Anjou, her adopted son who died just three months before she did. Pope Eugenius IV declared that as suzerain he had the right to invest the new King and as for now he would send a bishop as temporary regent. However the Neapolitan people, determined to respect the will of their former Queen, ignored the Papal resolution and sent a delegation to Provence to urge Renй of Anjou to claim the throne in Naples. Since Renй of Anjou had been taken captive in Burgundy by Duke Philip the Fair, his wife Isabelle of Lorraine accepted the crown in his place. From his base in Sicily, Alfons of Aragon, who was designated heir by Giovanna between 1420 and 1423, and had a claim to Naples as King of Sicily, gained the support of the Neapolitan nobility hostile to the Anjou dynasty, and started making preparations to invade the Kingdom before the French Angevins could arrive in Naples and take the crown.

<h3>Description</h3>
Two clerics, Scipio Saraceni and Marcantonio Brandolin were denounced and accused of rape, and murder. The Ten verified the justice of the charges and arrogated to itself the responsibility of trial and punishment. Pope Paul V demanded that the two be handed over to ecclesiastical courts. This matter brought to a head conflict that was already brewing with the church over the right to appoint a Patriach, taxes, and church properties in Venice. The Pope pronounced a sentence of excommunication, and laid an interdict on Venice. Venice turned to Paolo Sarpi, a theologian, expert in canon law, dialectician, scientist, and political philosopher to argue their case. Also, King Henry IV was asked to mediate with the Pope. The Papacy tried to save face, but it was clear that the interdict had failed. Never again would the Pope attempt to interdict a nation, and papal authority over Catholic Europe suffered a blow from which it could never quite recover.
